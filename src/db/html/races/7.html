<h3>Description</h3>
<h4><span class="caps">WARNING</span>
The dvati represents a radical new addition to the rules, as this race allows you to play a pair of twins. The rules are balanced against the core races, but this type of creature has no precedent in D&amp;D history. Before playing a dvati, be sure to check with your DM.</h4>
<p>Dvati are a strange race of humanoid creatures found in small enclaves scattered throughout the world and across the planes. All dvati are born identical twins, with the pair sharing a single soul between them. Dvati lore holds that their souls are so powerful that a single, mortal vessel is too weak to contain them. Thus, their minds occupy two bodies.</p>
<p>Typically peaceful folk, dvati are concerned more with philosophy and art than material pleasures. Much of their culture centers on the close link between a dvati pair. A pair of twins might paint a mural together, with each twin starting from one end and meeting at the middle to finish the creation. Dvati twins debate philosophy with each other with an eye toward not only uncovering higher truths but also questioning and exploring their own beliefs, attitudes, and preconceptions.</p>
<p>While dvati enjoy intellectual pursuits, they are capable warriors and hard workers. They consider archery, fencing, and similar combat talents art forms worthy of study. Dvati twins duel each other to press their talents and hone their abilities. The natural link between dvati twins makes them a deadly team, and the small but powerful dvati military units are renowned for their tactical coordination. Many times in the past, a tiny dvati force has defeated a much larger army with intricate and delicately timed plans.</p>
<p><strong>Personality:</strong> Dvati are typically serene, intellectually energetic, and curious. They tend to avoid conflict and are well suited to a role of peacemaker or diplomat. When faced with two sides in conflict, a dvati splits his twins. Each twin speaks from one side, finds areas of agreement with the other, smoothes over disagreements, and brings the two sides together.</p>
<p>Dvati have a strong sense of duality in all things. They excel at seeing both sides of an argument. When faced with a problem, a dvati is likely to spend time considering multiple approaches from different angles. A dvati who must move a boulder that blocks a cave stands in front of it and surveys the scene. Meanwhile, the other twin climbs above the stone, looks at the stone from above, and considers the same problem. To dvati, one perspective is never enough.</p>
<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> A dvati has a slight build, snow-white skin, black hair, and solid blue eyes that lack irises or pupils. Dvati noses are little more than small slits that barely protrude from their faces. They have three fingers and opposable thumbs. Most humanoids find a dvati&#39;s appearance&#8212;particularly their unwavering eyes&#8212; slightly unnerving. Dvati are acutely aware of this, and many of them wear hooded cloaks around strangers.</p>
<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Dvati get along well with most other races. Their ability to understand and appreciate different perspectives leads them to accept the differences in others with open minds. Outcast half-orcs and half-elves sometimes find homes in dvati communities. Of all the races, elves mingle best with dvati. Dvati respect the elves&#39; long-term view of history, their art, and their culture. Elves see dvati as fascinating creatures with a welcome appreciation of intellectual and artistic concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Most dvati are neutral, as they prefer a balanced approach to issues of morality. Many are also good. Being closely linked twins reminds dvati of the connections between all living things. They know that greed and unbridled ambition lead only to decay and misery. Evil dvati are almost utterly unknown. The link between two twins is too strong for any dvati to elevate himself above all others to the degree that evil promotes. Villainous dvati do exist in small numbers, however, and tend toward lawful evil.</p>
<p><strong>Dvati Lands:</strong> Dvati are too few in number to claim their own sprawling kingdoms and empires. Instead, they build small settlements in out-of-the-way areas where few trouble them. In rare cases, a small dvati colony arises in a city controlled by another race. These colonies are usually separated from the rest of the city by walls or carefully arranged buildings that leave only one or two entrances to a dvati neighborhood. While dvati appreciate other folk, they prefer peace, quiet, and solitude when they attend to their works.<br />Dvati artisans fetch high prices for their works, owing to the unique style of design they use. Dvati colonies are most common in realms that place a high value on philosophy, learning, and the arts.</p>
<p>When left to their own devices, dvati create small, orderly communities divided into four groups called rings. Each ring is ruled by a council of four dvati twins (two sets of twins), who in turn report to a smaller council of four more dvati. Dvati use a democratic system of elections, with each pair of twins allowed one vote. The rings are responsible for growing their own food, maintaining their section of the settlement, and so forth. When faced with an important decision,<br />The ruling councils call a gathering of the entire community. The twins separate into two groups, with one member of each pair in each meeting, to allow as many speakers as possible to present their views. The dvati as a whole then vote on a decision.</p>
<p><strong>Religion:</strong> Dvati worship Thelmeth the Unifier, a divine being represented by a sphere divided in two halves,&#8212; one black, one white. Thelmeth is typically depicted as a pair of male dvati twins clad in golden robes and wearing laurel wreaths, with each twin carrying a pair of large books. Thelmeth is neutral and his domains are Knowledge, Magic, and Protection. His favored weapon is the quarterstaff.</p>
<p><strong>Language:</strong> The dvati language requires two creatures speaking simultaneously to properly use it, and its unique alphabet consists of only eight characters. The character&#39;s alignment&#8212;upside down, mirrored to the left or right, or turned to the side&#8212;determines its exact sound. If a dvati is somehow separated from his twin, he uses Common to communicate with others.</p>
<p><strong>Names:</strong> A dvati&#39;s name in its native tongue is almost impossible for a non-dvati to speak or clearly understand, as both twins in the pair must speak at the same time to properly pronounce it. Thus, most dvati that work with other folk adopt names that they either make up or take from other languages. The dvati usually takes two names, one for each twin, although sometimes the dvati forgets which twin has which name. A dvati sees himself as an undivided pair, but he understands that other races might find him confusing. Dvati twins tend to prefer similar names with distinct sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Olon and Alax, Targren and Talon, Xephon and Xephar.</p>
<p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Esmerra and Esandra, Lia and Kira, Poldra and Eldra.</p>
<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Dvati adventurers are rare, as most of them prefer simple lives of contemplation, honest work, and fellowship. Sometimes a dvati feels a deep sense of wanderlust. Bored with the often repetitive existence of their colonies and settlements, young dvati strike out in search of new adventures. Some of these dvati are fascinated by other folk and wish to learn more about them. Others study philosophies that require the dvati to seek out new experiences. Dvati rarely adventure for material wealth or accolades, as such things have little value to a dvati aside from their pragmatic uses.</p>
<h3>Combat</h3>
<h3>Racial Traits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Medium: As Medium creatures, dvati have no special bonuses or penalties due to size.</li>
<li>Dvati base land speed is 30 feet.</li>
<li>Darkvision: Dvati can see in the dark to a range of up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dvati can function just fine with no light at all.</li>
<li>Twins:</li>
</ul>
<p>A &quot;single&quot; dvati is a pair of creatures that shares a soul. A dvati twin can no more exist without his soul partner than a human can live without a heart. The unique, spiritual link between a dvati pair has several important implications. A dvati character is actually two separate dvati twins who share a soul. These two creatures move and act separately but have a number of restrictions based on their connection. The dvati twins gain levels and progress in the same manner as a single creature of another race. The twins share a class and both have the same level. The twins do not progress at a different rate, nor do they split XP between them. Rather, each has an identical XP total. When dividing XP among characters, a dvati counts as one PC. </p>
<p>For example: A 1st-level dvati fighter consists of a pair of twins, each with the same set of fighter abilities. You select feats, skills, and other abilities for both twins. Do not choose them separately. If one twin has Power Attack, both twins gain access to it. In essence, you build one character who occupies two bodies, regardless of the class chosen. When a dvati casts a spell, both members of the pair must focus and concentrate on it. Both twins must simultaneously take the actions required to cast a spell, although only one must supply material components. One twin cannot cast a spell while the other attacks, for example. A lone can cast spells if his twin takes no actions while he casts. Any other sort of action, including a free one, makes it impossible for the casting twin to focus and use his spell. If the dvati tries to use a spell anyway, his casting attempt is ruined and the spell is lost.</p>
<p>The dvati twins divide their hit points between them. Each twin in the pair gains half the hit points from his Hit Die roll, although both gain the full benefits of his Constitution modifier. Do not roll Hit Dice separately for each dvati twin. For example, a 1st-level dvati fighter with a 13 Constitution gains 6 hit points for each twin ([10hp/2]+1=6). If an area of effect spell catches both twins, they save separately and take damage as normal.</p>
<p>A pair of dvati twins shares all class abilities and spells slots between them. For example, a 3rd-level dvati bard can use bardic music three times per day in total, not three times for each twin. Personal spells (those with a target of &quot;you&quot;) affect both twins as long as they are on the same plane. Otherwise, they affect only the caster. Other spells function as normal. For example, a touch spell normally affects only the specific twin touched. The spell conductor ability (detailed below) allows the dvati to share some spells.</p>
<p>A mind-affecting ability or spell that affects one twin affects both of them. If a single such ability targets both twins at the same time, they make only one save between them. Dvati twins share one mind.</p>
<p>The dvati twins have an innate, powerful psychic connection. They can communicate via telepathy at an unlimited range and across the planes. A twin cannot perceive what his other sees, hears, or otherwise perceives. As a full-round action, a dvati twin can determine his twin&#39;s current hit points and mental state. If one twin is on the same plane as the other, the twin learns the relative direction and distance to his partner.</p>
<p>If one dvati twin dies, the other slowly sickens and perishes. Each day that passes after a dvati twin dies, the surviving twin takes 1d4 points of Constitution and Wisdom damage and takes a cumulative -1 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws. The ability damage and penalties remain (and cannot be healed or removed) until the living twin dies or his soulmate returns to life (at which time they immediately disappear). Most dvati prefer to commit ritual suicide if one twin dies without hope of return, as the pain of losing the close bond drives a dvati to the brink of madness.<br />In most cases, an effect that applies to one twin fails to spill over to the other. If a medusa turns one twin to stone, the other remains healthy. Negative levels are an exception to this rule. If one dvati twin suffers a negative level, both of them incur its effects. The dvati makes one save to remove the negative level. Level loss caused by returning to life via a raise dead or similar spell affects both dvati twins.</p>
<ul>
<li>Echo Attack: By combining their voices into one maddening cacophony, a pair of dvati twins can confuse a creature they flank. If both twins speak as a move action while flanking an opponent, that creature must make a Will save. The DC of this save equals the result of a single Perform (sing) check made by the dvati. If the save fails, the twins gain their choice of a +1 bonus on attack rolls against the creature or a +1 bonus to Armor Class against the creature&#39;s strikes. This bonus lasts for 1 round. Creatures that cannot hear or be flanked are immune to this effect.</li>
<li>Pair Link: The close relationship between dvati twins grants them several benefits when they work together. If two dvati twins team up to flank an opponent, they each gain a +3 bonus on attack rolls, rather than the normal +2 bonus. If a twin uses the aid another action to help his twin, he grants an additional +2 bonus (for a total of +4) on attack rolls or to Armor Class.</li>
<li>Spell Conductor: A dvati twin can choose to shift a spell that affects him to his twin so long as both of them are on the same plane. The shifted spell must have a range of touch and it must also be harmless. Using this ability requires a move action to focus and channel the spell&#39;s power. Aside from the change in target, the spell&#39;s duration and effects continue as normal. A dvati can transfer a spell he casts from one twin to the other as part of the act of casting. He cannot transfer spells used by others.</li>
<li>Automatic Languages: Common and Dvati. Bonus Languages: Any. Dvati requires two creatures speaking simultaneously. One twin provides a description of actions, while the other supplies words and descriptions of things. The two weave together to communicate in a uniquely dvati manner. Other creatures can speak this tongue, but two Dvati-speaking creatures must work together. Otherwise, communication via this language is impossible. In most cases, dvati use Common to speak with other races.</li>
<li>Favored Class: Bard. A multiclass dvati&#39;s bard class does not count when determining whether he takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing. The dvati&#39;s strange, magical nature makes them natural Spellcasters, and their ability to meld their voices into one grants them an unmatched singing ability. Dvati bards are legendary for their ability to perform as flawless duos.</li>
<li>Level Adjustment: +1.</li>
