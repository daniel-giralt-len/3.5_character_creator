	"description": "Forge your name in battle!<br />The Complete Warrior provides you with an in-depth look at combat and provides detailed information on how to prepare a character for confrontation.<br />This title was not only compiled from various D&amp;D sources, but contains new things as well, including new battle-oriented character classes, prestige classes, combat maneuvers, feats, spells, magic items, and equipment. The prestige classes included have been revised and updated based on player feedback, and there are rules for unusual combat situations. The Complete Warrior will assist all class types, including those classes not typically associated with melee combat. There are also tips on running a martially focused campaign and advice on how to make your own prestige classes and feats.<br />To use this accessory, a Dungeon Master also needs the Player&#39;s Handbook, Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide, and Monster Manual. A player needs only the Player&#39;s Handbook."
