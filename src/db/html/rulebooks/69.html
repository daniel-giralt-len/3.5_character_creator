{"imgSrc": "/static/media/rulebook/oriental_adventures_cover.png","description": "Asian magic, combat, mystery, and monsters, all with a D&amp;D twist. It&#39;s a beautiful book that takes its graphic inspiration from the texture of handmade papers and the grace of calligraphy mixed with the kickin&#39; edge of the new D&amp;D style. Check out this new gallery of art drawn from the book, and if you haven&#39;t bought it yet, what&#39;s keeping you? All the great classes and races from the original 1st edition AD&amp;D are back and much, much more. And there are more weird, wonderful, mysterious Asian-inspired monsters than ever before -- from all the varieties of lung dragon, to the grisly mamono (wouldn&#39;t want to shake hands with one of those), to the classic hopping vampire (check him out in the Oriental Adventures excerpt). Get yourself warmed up with Chinese Ghost Story and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and then join the rest of your gaming group as they crack open their copies of the book and dive in for some serious Asian fantasy roleplaying."}
