	"description": "Legends Begin Here<br />Songs are sung and tales are told of heroes who have advanced beyond most adventuring careers. They confront mightier enemies and face deadlier challenges, using powers and abilities that rival even the gods.<br />This supplement for the D&amp;D game provides everything you need to transcend the first twenty levels of experience and advance characters to virtually unlimited levels of play. Along with epic magic items, epic monsters, and advice on running an epic campaign, the Epic Level Handbook also features epic NPCs from the Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk campaign settings.<br />To use this supplement, a Dungeon Master also needs the Player&#39;s Handbook, the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide, and the Monster Manual. A player needs only the Player&#39;s Handbook."
