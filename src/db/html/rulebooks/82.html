Living in harmony with the natural world, these noble individuals embark on grand adventures that become fireside tales for generations to come.<br />This supplement for the D&amp;D game provides detailed information on the psychology, society, culture, behavior, religion, folklore, and other aspects of the races of the wild, including raptorans -- a new race presented here. In addition to new humanoids and monster races playable as characters, Races of the Wild also provides new prestige classes, feats, spells, magic items, equipment, and guidelines for crafting adventures and campaigns within the communities of these tenacious folk."}
