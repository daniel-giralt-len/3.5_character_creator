For the blinding truths inscribed within offer nothing but redemption or destruction for the wicked. May these consecrated pages forever illuminate the paths of the righteous.<br />-- Raziel the Crusader, ruler of the Platinum Heaven<br />As the Book of Vile Darkness was a resource book on the most evil elements of campaign play, the Book of Exalted Deeds focuses instead on the availability of good resources and features in the D&amp;D spectrum.<br />Included are new exalted feats, prestige classes, races, spells, magic items, and descriptions and statistics for a host of creatures and celestial paragons to ally with virtuous characters. The Book of Exalted Deeds also provides descriptions and statistics for a host of creatures and celestial paragons to ally with virtuous characters.<br />Book of Exalted Deeds is the second title in the line of Dungeons &amp; Dragons products specifically aimed at a mature audience. <br />To use this supplement, a Dungeon Master also needs the Player&#39;s Handbook, Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide, and Monster Manual.
