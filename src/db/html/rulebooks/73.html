	"description": "A follow-up to the Player&#39;s Handbook designed to aid players and provide more character options.<br />The Player&#39;s Handbook II builds upon existing materials in the Player&#39;s Handbook. This is the first direct followup to the best-selling and most used D&amp;D rulebook. It is specifically designed to expand the options available for players by both providing new material and increasing the uses for existing rules. Included are chapters on character race, background, classes, feats, spells, character creation, and character advancement. New rules include racial affiliations that make race matter as a character advances in level, new character classes and alternate class features for existing classes, new feats, tools for rapid character creation, and additional organization and teamwork benefits -- an option first introduced in Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide II and Heroes of Battle."
