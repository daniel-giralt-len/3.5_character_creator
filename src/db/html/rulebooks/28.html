	"description": "Weave exciting tales of heroism filled with magic and monsters. Within these pages, you&#39;ll discover the tools and options you need to create detailed worlds and dynamic adventures for your players to experience in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons roleplaying game.<br />The revised Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide is an essential rulebook for Dungeon Masters of the D&amp;D game. The Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide has been reorganized to be more user friendly. It features information on running a D&amp;D game, adjudicating play, writing adventures, nonplayer characters (including nonplayer character classes), running a campaign, characters, magic items (including intelligent and cursed items, and artifacts), and a dictionary of special abilities and conditions. Changes have been made to the item creation rules and pricing, and prestige classes new to the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide are included (over 10 prestige classes). The revision includes expanded advice on how to run a campaign and instructs players on how to take full advantage of the tie-in D&amp;D miniatures line."
