All aberrant mark spell-like abilities can be used once per day. When you select this feat, you must choose an aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability from the following list. You can never improve this mark in any way, and you can never gain a second mark. A character with one of the true dragonmarks (least, lesser, or greater) cannot select this feat, and a character with this feat cannot later select one of the true dragonmark feats. A saving throw against your aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability has a DC of 10 + spell level + your Cha modifier. (Spell level for an aberrant dragonmark ability is always 1st.) Your caster level for your aberrant dragonmark spell-like ability is one-half your character level. Aberrant Mark Powers: burning hands, cause fear, charm person, chill touch, detect secret doors, feather fall, inflict light wounds, jump, light, pass without trace, produce flame, shield, Tenser's floating disk. Aberrant dragonmarks are mutations that appear occasionally among the dragonmarked races (usually to those not of a dragonmarked house) that can be traced back to the blood lines of corrupted dragonmarked families eliminated in the War of the Mark. At a quick glance, an aberrant mark could be mistaken for an established dragonmark, but on close inspection its differences are readily apparent.",

Alternatively, the item may have belonged to another person to whom you are somehow connected, such as another member of your religious order. At any time, you may retreat to a consecrated or hallowed location and spend time in prayer in order to awaken the spirits in your ancestral relic. This requires a sacrifice of valuable items worth the difference between the market price of the magic item your relic will become and the market price of your current relic. This sacrifice does not have to be gold--you can sacrifice magic items or other goods worth the required amount, rather than selling your goods (at half value) to pay for the sacrifice. You must spend 1 day per 1,000 gp value you sacrifice. During this time, you must spend at least 8 hours each day in prayer or meditation, not stopping to eat or rest. For example, a 4th-level paladin has a masterwork bastard sword she inherited from her grandfather. She makes sacrifices worth 2,000 gp and spends two days in prayer and fasting in the temple of Heironeous. When she emerges, her devotion has awakened the magic inherent in the blade, making it a +1 bastard sword. When she reaches 7th level, she once again retreats to the temple for 6 days, sacrificing items worth an additional 6,000 gp to make her weapon a +2 bastard sword (market price 8,000 gp). When she reaches 11th level, she can make it a +2 holy bastard sword by making sacrifices worth 24,000 gp (the difference between 32,000 and 8,000 gp) and spending 24 days in prayer. A character's level dictates the maximum value of his or her ancestral relic, as shown in Table 4-2. No character may have more than one ancestral relic. Table 4-2: Ancestral Relic Character Maximum Character Maximum Level Relic Value Level Relic Value. 3rd - 1,350 gp. 4th - 2,700 gp. 5th - 4,500 gp. 6th - 6,500 gp. 7th - 9,500 gp. 8th - 13,500 gp. 9th - 18,000 gp. 10th - 24,500 gp. 11th - 33,000 gp. 12th - 44,000 gp. 13th - 55,000 gp. 14th - 75,000 gp. 15th - 100,000 gp. 16th - 130,000 gp. 17th - 170,000 gp. 18th - 220,000 gp. 19th - 290,000 gp. 20th - 380,000 gp.",

For the purpose of this single attack, you can ignore a number of points of damage reduction (except DR/-- or DR/epic) up to twice your Charisma bonus (if any). For instance, if your Charisma is 17 (+3 bonus), you ignore 6 points of your target's damage reduction when making a demolishing smite. Overwhelming Smite: Your smite attack can knock an opponent prone. If the attack hits and deals damage, it is treated as though it were also a trip attack. Make a Strength check opposed by the defender's Strength or Dexterity, with all the normal trip modifiers (PH 158). A foe that resists is not entitled to make a trip attempt against you in return. You can attempt an overwhelming smite only once per round. Seeking Smite: Your smite attack is uncannily guided to its target. For the purpose of this single attack, you ignore any miss chance your foe might have, though your weapon must still be able to strike the target. Thus, while this maneuver allows you to strike an incorporeal creature unerringly with a magic sword, it does not allow you to strike it with a nonmagical weapon.",

If the spell normally allows a saving throw, the target takes half the negative energy damage on a successful save, regardless of the outcome of the save on the spell's normal effect. In addition to its normal spell components, a Moilian spell requires the creation and expenditure of a Moilian runebone-- a small human bone (often a fi nger bone) scribed with carefully prepared arcane markings. Only a character trained in the Black Lore of Moil knows the secrets of creating a runebone, which takes 1 hour to craft and requires special inks and powders costing 25 gp per die of negative energy damage to be generated. For example, a runebone capable of adding 3d6 points of negative energy damage to a spell costs 75 gp to craft. While the maximum negative energy damage dealt by a Moilian spell is based on the spell's level, the actual damage is limited by the runebone. For example, if a sorcerer casts fi nger of death (a 7th-level spell, so normally +4d6) with a 75-gp (3d6) runebone, the spell deals only 3d6 points of additional negative energy damage.

You can attack with both your spiked armor and a spiked shield on this charge, each one benefiting from the Strength bonus, but you take the normal penalties for using two weapons. Spiked Rebuke: When you are fighting defensively and carrying a spiked shield, you lash out at your foes with your shield in response to their attacks. Determine what your AC would be without your spiked shield and the AC bonus for fighting defensively. If an opponent's attack hits against this lower AC but misses against your actual AC, the foe strikes your shield, allowing you to defl ect his attack in such a way as to leave him vulnerable to your counter. On your next action, you gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls against your chosen foe with your spiked shield. Spiked Slam: As a full-round action when you are wielding a spiked shield, you can opt to make only a single attack at your best base attack bonus. You brace yourself behind your spiked shield, drive yourself forward, and slam into your foe. You enter your foe's space, which provokes attacks of opportunity. In return, your attack deals extra damage equal to twice your Strength and an additional amount based on your size (see below). After making this attack, you stumble back into the square you occupied just before making this attack. Until the start of your next turn, you do not threaten any squares. Size -- Additional Damage.

In addition to the obvious harmful effect this has upon you, this action is a drain on your personal energy. Once the effect of the intervention is resolved, you become fatigued. You cannot use this feat if you are exhausted or if you are immune to fatigue. You can choose to activate this feat after the success or failure of the harmful effect is determined, but you must activate it before the extent of the effect is determined and/or applied to the ally. Example: If an adjacent ally is attacked, you could wait until after the attack roll (and confi rmation roll, if the attack is a critical threat) is made to activate the feat, but you would have to activate it before damage is rolled. If the adjacent creature also benefi ts from a miss chance, you could wait until after that roll was made to activate the feat. Example: If an adjacent creature is within the area of a lightning bolt spell, you could wait until the creature rolls its saving throw (and checks its spell resistance, if any), but you would have to activate the feat before the spell's damage is rolled. If an adjacent creature is targeted by an attack that deals a fi xed amount of damage, such as a maximized magic missile spell, you would choose to activate this feat after the spell hit the target, but before damage was applied. By activating this feat, you give up any opportunity to avoid the harmful effect normally allowed by a saving throw, spell resistance, AC, or concealment. If the effect allows a saving throw or spell resistance, you automatically fail the save or spell resistance check. If the effect requires an attack roll, it automatically hits you (and if it scored a critical hit, it automatically scores a critical hit on you), even if you would normally benefi t from a miss chance against the attack. Any immunities or resistances you have apply normally; for example, if you are immune to critical hits, an attacker can't score a critical hit on you just because he scored one on the ally. If you can't physically interact with or manipulate objects (for instance, if you are incorporeal or in gaseous form, or if either you or the ally, but not both of you, are ethereal), you can't switch places with the ally and thus can't activate this feat.

In the round after you breathe, the clinging breath weapon deals half of the damage it dealt in the previous round. Creatures that avoid damage from the breath weapon (such as creatures with the evasion special quality or incorporeal creatures) do not take the extra damage. For example, an old silver dragon uses its cold breath and deals 72 points of cold damage (or 36 points against a target that makes its save). In the following round, foes that failed their saves against the breath weapon initially take an additional 36 points of cold damage, and foes that succeeded on their saves take 18 points of cold damage. A foe can take a full-round action to attempt to remove the clinging breath weapon before taking any additional damage. It takes a successful Reflex saving throw (same DC as your normal breath weapon) to remove the effect. Rolling around on the ground grants a +2 bonus on the saving throw, but leaves the foe prone. A clinging breath weapon cannot be removed or smothered by jumping into water. A clinging breath weapon can be magically dispelled (DC equal to your breath weapon save DC).",

Since the ogre does not have any sort of grappling special ability or feat, it fails to start a grapple. Then an ankheg--a creature with the improved grab special ability--attempts to grapple Tordek.

Cloak Defense: While you are fighting defensively, you can use your cloak to confuse your foes. You hold it before your chest like a curtain, making it diffi cult for enemies to read your defensive moves. Your cloak grants you a +1 shield bonus to AC. If you use the total defense action, your cloak's shield bonus improves to +2. (Shield bonuses do not stack, making it likely that this maneuver is a poor option if you already carry a shield.) Cloaked Strike: You can use your cloak to hide a light weapon. To utilize this maneuver, on the first round you must move adjacent to an opponent while you do not have a weapon in either hand. On the second round, you make a Bluff check opposed by your foe's Sense Motive check as you use a move action to draw your weapon. If this check succeeds, your opponent loses either his Dexterity bonus to AC or his shield bonus to AC (your choice) until the end of your current turn. Whirling Cloak: You can attempt to use your cloak to confuse your opponent. As a move action after successfully striking an opponent in melee, make a melee touch attack against that foe. If this attack hits, you whirl your cloak around him, temporarily ruining his defenses. Your opponent cannot make attacks of opportunity against a particular ally of your choice until the start of his next turn.",

As your foe swings at you, you slip out of the way, causing his attack to slam into one of his allies. By positioning yourself correctly and making yourself an appealing target, you dupe your foe into making a critical blunder. To use this maneuver, you must be successfully attacked by a foe. On your next turn, you can take a move action to make a Bluff check opposed by his Sense Motive check. If you succeed on the check, you can take an immediate action at the start of your foe's next turn and designate a different target for your opponent's next melee attack (which must be a creature it threatens). Play Dead: You crumple to the ground as if slain, luring your opponent into a false sense of security. As an immediate action after you are hit for at least 10 points of damage by a single attack, you can attempt to play dead. You drop prone and make a Bluff check opposed by your attacker's (or any other relevant observer's) Sense Motive check. If you succeed on this check, the observer assumes you are dead. If you subsequently rise and attack him in the same round, he loses any attack of opportunity he might have been entitled to against you, and he loses his Dexterity bonus to AC against the fi rst attack that you make. You can use this ability once per encounter. Standing up after playing dead does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Sneering Glower: With just the right mix of your intimidating presence and your martial talents, you strike such fear into your target that he has diffi culty fighting you effectively. On your next turn after you deal at least 1 point of damage to your opponent, you can make an Intimidate check against him as a move action. If you succeed on this check, your foe takes a penalty on his attack rolls against you equal to your Charisma bonus. You can gain this benefit against only one foe at a time; it lasts for the duration of the encounter or until you switch targets. If you designate a new target for this ability (by attempting a new Intimidate check against a different creature), the previous target no longer takes the penalty on his attack rolls against you. Opponents that are immune to the effects of the Intimidate skill, such as mindless creatures and those with immunity to fear, are immune to this maneuver.",

Moreover, a crystal capacitor's maximum is always an odd number. For instance, you'd never find a crystal capacitor with a maximum storage capacity of 6 power points (but you would find those that store a maximum of 5 or 7), or one that stores more than 17. Note that during use, a crystal capacitor very often contains even numbers of power points, just not when fully charged.

The base price of a crystal capacitor is equal to the highest-level power it could manifest using all its stored power points, squared, multiplied by 1,000 gp.

    "benefit": "You can interpret the basic symbolism of a dream to fi gure out what sorts of concerns or fears are likely to have inspired it. Dream Being Interpreted ---- Knowledge (the planes) DC. Features obvious symbolism ---- 10. Involves cultural details or concepts with which you are not very familiar ---- 15. Represents memories of past events with which you are not familiar ---- 20. Both the previous conditions are true ---- 25. Attempting to garner insight into future events, or events occurring elsewhere, by reading the prophetic images of a dream adds +10 to +20 to the base DC, depending on how obscure the omens are. The DM must decide if a dream contains prophetic imagery; a suffi ciently high roll might glean some information even if the dream was not overtly oracular. Making the DC required to interpret a dream grants information comparable to an augury spell (see page 202 of the Player's Handbook). Exceeding the required check by 10 or more offers information comparable to a divination spell (see page 224 of the Player's Handbook). Exceeding the required check by 20 or more offers information comparable to a commune spell (see page 211 of the Player's Handbook). Even if your result was not high enough to enable you to read prophetic images, the result might be sufficient to interpret basic symbols and events. Thus, a check result of 18 is insuffi cient to foretell the future but still grants some information about cultural details or concepts. You can use this feat to determine what effect injuries received in a dreamscape are likely to have on you once you return (DC 15), or whether an item or location was created by the dreamer or brought in from outside (DC 20); see Chapter 3 for information on adventuring within dreamscapes. Finally, this feat allows Knowledge (the planes) to function in place of Survival when used within a dreamscape. This skill can be used to retrace your steps and return to a known person's dream, or to attempt to track a creature across the dreamscape. Action: Dreamtelling requires careful analysis of bizarre images and events. If you are trying to interpret your own dream, you must cogitate on it for a number of minutes equal to 30 minus your Intelligence modifi er. If you wish to analyze someone else's dream, that person must fi rst describe it to you in great detail, adding an additional 10+1d10 minutes to the process. Try Again: No. The check represents your ability to interpret that particular dream. You can attempt to interpret other dreams the same individual has later, but you get only one attempt per dream. Similarly, you have only one attempt to determine whether an item is native to a particular dream.",

The flames of your second spell turn some of the lingering acid into choking, sickening fumes. Any living creature damaged by both spells is nauseated for 1 round. Those who make a successful Fortitude save (DC based on the second spell) are sickened for 1 round instead. Treat this as a poison effect for the purpose of save bonuses and immunities. Brittle Blast: You cast a cold spell followed by a sonic spell. Any object or construct damaged by both spells takes +50% damage from the sonic spell, because its physical structure has been made brittle by the cold. Improved Conduction: You cast a cold spell followed by an electricity spell. The lingering cold more effectively conducts the electricity, temporarily fatiguing creatures. Living creatures damaged by both spells are slowed for 1 round (as the slow spell). Creatures that make successful Fortitude saves (DC based on the second spell) are fatigued for 1 round.",

A substituted spell works normally in all respects, except that the type of damage dealt changes. For example, an acidic fireball still deals damage in a 20-foot spread, except that it is acid damage instead of fire damage. If a spell has a secondary effect, the altered spell still has that effect. For example, a shout spell can deafen creatures and deals extra damage to crystalline creatures; if fire is substituted for sonic energy in a shout spell, creatures can still be deafened and crystalline creatures still suffer extra damage. Sometimes a spell's minor effects are directly related to the spell's energy, for example, a flaming sphere can set items afire, but a purely sonic or acidic flaming sphere does not. When a spell deals some damage that does not come from energy, Energy Substitution does not affect that portion of the spell. For example, ice storm deals 3d6 points of impact damage and 2d6 points of cold damage. An electrical ice storm deals 3d6 points of impact damage and 2d6 points of electricity damage. A substituted spell uses a spell slot zero levels higher than (the same as) the spell's actual level.",

    "benefit": "Whenever you need to expend experience points to craft a magic item or cast a spell with an XP component, you can draw upon the life force of a nearby demon to reduce the XP cost to you. Before beginning the process, you must secure a demon whose Hit Dice equal or exceed the caster level of the item or spell in question. The demon could be one that you summoned with a planar ally spell, or one that you have bound with a planar binding spell, or even one that you simply encountered and convinced to aid you. The demon need not be willing, but it must remain within 30 feet of you for the duration of your work on the item or the casting time of the spell, and you must have line of effect (but not necessarily line of sight) to it during that time. Drawing essence from a demon does not increase the time required to craft the item or cast the spell, but the process is draining for both you and the demon. Each of you takes ld6 points of Constitution damage when the essence is channeled from the demon into your body, then converted into magical energy. An unwilling demon can attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Cha modifier) to resist removal of its essence. Success negates your use of this feat and forces you to either pay the full cost yourself or abort the creation or casting. Successfully drawing essence from a demon in this way reduces the XP cost of the spell or item creation by one-half, but it complicates the process. If you use this feat to reduce the XP cost of a spell, you must succeed on a Concentration check (DC 20 + the demon's HD) to cast the spell. If you use this feat to offset the XP cost of crafting a magic item, the demon's essence has a 10% chance to corrupt the item in some way, imbuing it with a curse. (The DM determines the nature of this curse randomly by rolling on the tables on pages 272-273 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.)",

Favors can also be used to acquire the loan of equipment or documents from infl uential acquaintances. To call in a favor, you make a favor check. Roll a d20 and add a bonus based on your character level: +1 at 1st-2nd level, +2 at 3rd-6th level, +3 at 7th-11th level, +4 at 12th- 15th level, or +5 at 16th level or higher. The DM sets the DC based on the scope of the favor being requested; it can range from 10 for a simple favor to as high as 25 for highly dangerous, expensive, or illegal favors. You can't take 10 or take 20 on this check, nor can you retry the check for the same (or virtually the same) favor. Favors should help advance the plot of an adventure. A favor that would enable you to circumvent an adventure will always be unavailable to you, regardless of the result of a favor check. You can try to call in a favor a number of times per week equal to one-half your character level, rounded down (minimum one). You can never ask for more than one favor from any one contact in a given week. For instance, at 7th level you can try to call in a favor as many as three times per week, but each attempt must involve a different contact from among those associated with your mercantile house. The DM will carefully monitor your use of favors to ensure that you don't abuse this ability. The success or failure of a mission shouldn't hinge on the use of a favor, and calling in favors shouldn't replace good roleplaying or the use of other skills. The DM may disallow any favor he or she deems disruptive to the campaign.",

    "benefit": "When you cast a spell that deals damage to a giant, you deal an extra 2d6 points of damage. A single spell can never gain this extra damage more than once per casting. For instance, a fireball deals the extra damage to all giants in the area it affects. However. si a 3rd-level wizard casts mag\\c missile and produces two missiles. only one of I hem (of the wizard s choice) gains the extra damage, whether or not both missiles are directed at the same giant or two different giants. If a spell deals damage for more than I round, it deals this extra damage in each round. If the spell allows a saving throw, the DC of the saving throw increases by 2. The additional damage dealt by ibis spell is either haKed on a successful saving throw or negated entirely, depending on how the regular damage dealt by the spell is affected by a successful saving throw. Scrolls scribed by you do not gain any benefit from Giant Banemagic. Scrolls activvted by yon also gain no benefit from Giant Banemagic. The same is true for most other magic items, such as wands and potions. However staffs activated by you use not only your caster level but also gain the benefit of this feat if applicable.",

If there is no unoccupied square on the opposite side of the foe or you fail the Tumble check, you remain in the square you are in and have failed to duck underneath your foe. Death from Below: To use this maneuver, you must have successfully used the duck underneath maneuver. You may make an immediate single attack against the foe you ducked underneath. That foe is treated as fl at-footed, and you gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll. Climb Aboard: To use this maneuver, you must move adjacent to a foe at least two size categories larger than you. In the following round, you may make a DC 10 Climb check as a free action to clamber onto the creature's back or limbs (you move into one of the squares the creature occupies). The creature you're standing on takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls against you, because it can strike at you only awkwardly. If the creature moves during its action, you move along with it. The creature can try to shake you off by making a grapple check opposed by your Climb check. If the creature succeeds, you wind up in a random adjacent square.",

If you make a successful melee attack against an opponent who has walls adjacent to at least two sides of his space, you can make a special Tumble check on your next turn. This check requires a full-round action. As part of this action, make a Tumble check to move through the target's space. On a successful check, you stop in his space (rather than move past him) and attack as part of your full-round action. If the check fails, you provoke an attack of opportunity, and the rest of your full-round action is wasted. If your melee attack hits, you move your foe S feet in a direction of your choice. You now occupy the space that he occupied {or one of the spaces of your choice). If your melee attack misses, you return to the space you occupied when you started this maneuver. Wall Leaper: If you drop from a wall while climbing and land adjacent to a creature, you can make one attack as a standard action.

To use this maneuver, you must first cast a cure spell, then attempt either a melee attack or a Strength-based check in the following round.

Conduit of Life: Two conduits of positive energy (turning and healing) reinforce each other, making your cure spells more potent. To use this maneuver, you must first attempt to turn undead, then make an attack with a cure spell (or other positive-energy spell) against an undead creature in the following round. You gain a bonus on your damage roll for the spell equal to one-half the result of the initial turning check, and the save DC increases by an amount equal to your Charisma bonus (if any). If you roll a natural 20 on your attack roll when delivering the spell (assuming one is necessary) and the target fails its save, the spell deals double damage. Conduit of Death: Two conduits of negative energy (rebuking and dealing damage) reinforce each other, making your inflict spells more potent. To use this maneuver, you must first attempt to rebuke undead, then make an attack with an inflict spell (or other negative-energy spell) against a living creature in the following round. You gain a bonus on your damage roll for the spell equal to one-half the result of the initial turning check, and the save DC increases by an amount equal to your Charisma bonus (if any), furthermore, the critical threat range of the attack increases by l. Touch of Death: The negative energy you channel lingers, increasing the severity of the wounds you inflict. To use this maneuver, you must first cast an inflict spell, then attempt a melee attack against a living creature in the following round.

In addition, it can be used an additional two times per day, or continuously if it could otherwise be used three times or more each day. For example, if you make a pair of winged boots, they grant a fly speed of 90 feet and can be used continuously as long as they are used within Sharn. (Normally, winged boots function three times per day.) The market price for the boots is unchanged. If you make a carpet of flying, it grants a fly speed of 60 feet within Sharn and is otherwise unchanged (since carpets of flying normally work continuously). In addition to allowing you to make improved versions of standard items at a lower cost, this feat is a prerequisite for creating certain magic items unique to Sharn.

For example, a paladin's smite evil attacks are treated as having the good alignment and deal +1d6 damage to evil targets, while a blackguard's smite good attacks are treated as having the evil alignment and deal +1d6 damage to good targets. If the smite attack has no alignment associated with it, you must choose an alignment component (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) when you select the feat. Your smite attacks overcome damage reduction as if they had that alignment, and deal +1d6 points of damage to foes of the opposite alignment.

A lawful evil cleric of Hextor with the Destruction domain could choose to have his smite attacks be lawfully or evilly aligned (and these attacks would deal +1d6 points of damage to chaotic targets or to good targets, respectively). You can't choose an alignment component that isn't part of your alignment, and once this choice is made, it can never be changed. If you later change alignment so that the chosen alignment component is no longer part of your alignment, you lose the BENEFITS: of this feat.",

    "benefit": "This feat expands the way you can use the Search skill by allowing you to notice and analyze available clues in a specifi c area. This use of the Search skill is a fullround action. Clues are pieces of evidence that lead to the solution of a mystery. Clues are physical and can be seen, heard, touched, smelled, or tasted. A clue stands out because it's not a normal feature of the area being searched. Examples of clues include a trampled f lowerbed, a broken urn, a pin snapped off in a lock, a torn strip of cloak, a burnt scrap of scroll, or a brooch clutched in a dead man's fi st. Add the following task to the list provided in the Player's Handbook description of the Search skill. Task Search DC. Find a clue 10. So, in addition to using Search to fi nd a certain item, notice a secret door, or fi nd a footprint, you have the additional training and experience necessary to fi nd clues of all sorts. Modify the Search DC according to the nature of the scene being examined, as indicated below. (This function of the Search skill doesn't reveal clues when there are no clues to fi nd.) Scene Condition Search DC Modifi er Undisturbed +0. (The scene has not been touched or contaminated in any way.) Disturbed +5. (Someone or something has slightly and perhaps unintentionally contaminated the scene; for example, a book was picked up and put back or a guard walked cautiously across the area.) Greatly disturbed +10. (Someone or something has massively and intentionally contaminated the scene; for example, the area has been cleaned and scrubbed, or the area was intentionally disturbed after the primary event occurred.) When a successful Search check turns up a clue, you can make a second check to discern patterns, analyze evidence, and draw conclusions about what occurred in a specifi c area. In other words, the fi rst Search check lets you fi nd something, and the second check allows you to fi gure out what you've found. You can make a DC 15 Search check to analyze a clue. By examining a body, you might determine whether the victim fought back or provided no struggle at all, or if claws, a weapon, or a spell killed the victim. By looking at a scorch mark on a wall, you might approximate the location of the spellcaster when the spell was cast. The DC for the check is modifi ed by the time that has elapsed since the event occurred and how signifi cant the clue is, as indicated below. All other rules concerning the Search skill otherwise apply. Circumstance (example) DC Modifi er Each day past since event +2. (Maximum modifier +10) Minor clue +0. (Provides only a piece of the solution to a puzzle and requires additional data for the investigator to reach a conclusion.) Moderate clue +2. (Provides signifi cant data toward the solution of a puzzle and could lead to a conclusion without additional data.) Major clue +5. (Provides everything an investigator needs to solve a puzzle, even if the solution isn't immediately obvious.) The DM should secretly make the second Search check to analyze a clue. If the check succeeds, the DM provides a truthful, objective analysis of the clue that can help the investigator reach a reasonable and logical conclusion. For example, analyzing a brooch clutched in the hand of a murdered dwarf (a major clue) reveals that it was torn from a blue cloak or tunic (it bears strands of a blue material). It bears the symbol of House Cannith, but the brooch isn't of the quality that a house noble would normally wear. These true and objective facts are now left for the investigator to consider and follow up on. If the check fails, the DM provides analysis of the clue that sounds plausible but is actually fl awed in some manner. For example, a fl awed analysis of the major clue discussed above would reveal only that the brooch bears the symbol of House Cannith. Even a successful analysis won't reveal the actual authenticity of a clue. False clues planted at a scene could provide truthful and objective data that leads an investigator in the wrong direction. Generally, investigating a scene a second time doesn't add new insight unless another clue is discovered. You can take 10 when making a Search check to fi nd a clue, but you can't take 20. Synergy: If you have 5 or more ranks in an appropriate Knowledge skill, you get a +2 bonus on Search checks to fi nd or analyze clues.",

The power that is manifested in this round is not altered in any way, nor is the linked power that goes off in the next round--however, you do not need to spend any of your actions or power points next round to manifest the linked power. The linked power is automatically targeted on the same area or target as the power you manifest in this round (if the power you manifest this round has no area or target, choose an area or target in this round for the linked power to affect in the next round). If the same creature is targeted by both powers, the target experiences all the effects of both powers individually and receives a saving throw (if applicable) for each. In some cases, such as a psionic charm followed by a linked psionic charm, failing both saving throws results in redundant effects (although, in this example, any ally of the target would have to succeed on two dispel attempts to free the target from the charm effect). It is possible that by the time the linked power comes into effect on the following round, the area where it goes off or the target that it affects no longer has relevance. On the other hand, you are free on the subsequent round to take actions normally. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power manifested this round by a number equal to the power point cost of the linked power. Thus if you manifest energy stun (3 power points) and energy burst (5 power points) as the linked power, the metapsionic cost is 8. The total of power points you spend in this manner cannot exceed your manifester level.",

For the purpose of this feat, a natural setting is defined as any location not within a community and not a constructed area. &quot;Natural setting&quot; includes unworked caverns, but not crafted dungeons and the like. To use the feat, you must succeed on a Knowledge (nature) check (DC 15 + spell level), made as a free action while casting a spell. You can't take 10 on this check. If you succeed, each target of your spell is healed of 2 points of damage per spell level, in addition to the spell's normal effects. If the spell doesn't have a target entry, this feat has no effect. This healing power is positive energy, so an undead creature instead takes 2 points of damage per spell level. An unwilling creature can attempt a Will save (at the spell's normal save DC) to negate this effect. If the skill check fails, the prepared spell or spell slot is lost. You cannot use this feat on any spell with an alignment descriptor, nor with any necromancy spell. The natural world favors balance in all things, and thus does not support specific alignment-based magic, nor can its life-giving power be used to enhance the magic of death.",

    "benefit": "A mortalbane ability is a damaging spell-like ability that deals 2d6 points of additional damage when used against living nonoutsiders, but only half damage (rounded down) against outsiders, undead, and constructs. For example, if a mortalbane cone of cold froma gelugon would normally deal 45 points of damage, it actually deals 45 + 2d6 points of damage to a humanoid, but only 22 points of damage to a night hag. Creatures immune to cold--regardless of their type--still take no damage from a mortalbane cone of cold. Mortalbane can be applied to each of a creature's spell-like abilities five times per day, though the feat does not allow the creature to exceed its normal usage limit for any ability. Thus, if a gelugon chooses to apply Mortalbane to its cone of cold ability, it can use a mortalbane cone of cold up to five times that day. Thereafter, it could use its cone of cold ability again normally (since it can use cone of cold at will).",

A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic reserve may take a single move action or standard action each round (but not both, nor can it take full-round actions). It moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn't risk further injury, but performing any standard action (or any other action the DM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a quickened spell) immediately expends the necrotic reserve. Unless the action increased the weakened undead's hit points, it is destroyed. A weakened undead acting on the strength of its necrotic reserve is also destroyed if it is dealt additional damage after the attack that fi rst weakened it. An undead may only rely on a necrotic reserve up to once per day, even if it engages in additional feeding following its successful return to positive hit points.",

    "benefit": "When you take this feat, you must choose the energy type you selected with your Privileged Energy feat. To use this feat, you must expend your psionic focus. Upon manifesting a damaging energy power that matches your choice of energy, you can access paraelemental energy to further enhance your energy power with ice (cold), magma (fire), ooze (electricity), or smoke (sonic). The paraelemental power still possesses its underlying energy descriptor. Targets damaged by paraelemental powers might be affected by the additional effects noted below. In the case of an energy power that requires a saving throw, targets are only subject to these additional effects on a failed save. A successful save against the energy power negates the paraelemental effect. In the case of an energy power that normally does not allow a saving throw (such as energy ray), a target of a paraelemental power can attempt a Fortitude save at the powers DC to negate only the extra effect. Ice: As cold energy, but also limits affected foes to a single move action or standard action (not both) for 1 round as they attempt to free themselves from ice. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. Magma: As fire energy, but also deals an additional 2d6 points of fire damage on the round following the attack from lingering magma. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. Ooze: As electricity energy, but the target is also covered in goo and becomes entangled for 1 round, after which the goo evaporates. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. Smoke: As sonic, but targets that breathe spend the following round coughing, and so are limited to a single move action or standard action (not both) for 1 round. The power is considered to be in effect during this time and can be dispelled normally. Using this feat increases the power point cost of the power by 2.

Quasit ------------------ Chaotic evil ---- 7th. *New template; see Chapter 6: Creatures of the Planes. 1 Apply the anarchic, axiomatic, celestial, or fiendish template to any animal from the standard familiar list. Unlike other improved familiars, these creatures grant their masters the standard benefits for having an animal familiar of that type. 2 Air, earth, fire, or water elemental only. 3 Standard only. If you are using the Fiend Folio, you may use a filth imp instead. The improved familiar is magically linked to its master in the same way as a normal familiar. The familiar uses the basic statistics for a creature of its kind, as given in the Monster Manual or this book, except as noted below. Hit Dice: For effects that depend upon Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal Hit Dice total, whichever is higher. Hit Points: Use one-half the master's total or the familiar's normal total, whichever is higher. Attacks: Use the master's base attack bonus or the familiar's, whichever is better. Saving Throws: For each saving throw, use the master's base save bonus (as calculated from his character level) or the familiar's, whichever is better. Familiar Special Abilities: Use the second table in the Familiars sidebar, page 53 of the Player's Handbook, to determine additional abilities, just as you would for a normal familiar. With the exception of anarchic, axiomatic, celestial, and fi endish animals, planar familiars do not grant their masters any of the benefi ts that appear on the fi rst table in that sidebar.",

You also gain the capacity to retain uses of one more planar touchstone's higher-order ability. Thus, you could retain the base abilities for both the Breaching Obelisk and Echolost (planar touchstone locations described in Chapter 7), as well as both sites' higher-order uses, simultaneously. If you then visit a third planar touchstone and fulfi ll its recharge condition, unless you have taken this feat three times, you must choose which of your two previous touchstone site abilities to lose when you gain the abilities of the third touchstone site.",
    "benefit": "Choose any site designated as a planar touchstone for which you also possess an object native to that location, as noted in this feat's prerequisite. When this feat is first taken, forging a link between yourself and a chosen planar touchstone takes 24 hours of uninterrupted concentration. To forge a link, you must spend 10 experience points and expend the object described in this feat's prerequisite. Once the link is forged, you gain the base ability described for that touchstone. If you physically visit the planar location once you've forged a link, you also gain a higherorder ability with a limited number of uses, as described for that planar touchstone. You may repeatedly visit the planar touchstone, each time recharging your usages of the higher-order ability. Usages of a higher-order ability do not stack, so visiting your planar touchstone prior to using up any of your higher-order usages confers no additional benefit. Once you've established a link with one planar touchstone site by taking this feat, you may also freely visit other planar touchstones. When you do so and fulfi ll the higherorder ability's recharge condition for the alternate site, you immediately gain the base ability of the new planar touchstone site and lose the base ability of the previous site. You also lose any remaining uses of the higher-order ability of your previously selected site (if any), and instead gain the specifi ed number of higher-order ability uses appropriate to the new site. In this way, you can &quot;unplug&quot; from one site and &quot;plug in&quot; to a new planar touchstone site as often as you desire. Thus, after expending the raw materials and experience points for making your fi rst connection, making subsequent connections with different sites is as easy as fulfi lling the higherorder recharge condition.",

For instance, you can give your psicrystal an 8th-level power (cost 15 power points) and a 4th-level power (cost 7 power points). It gains a reserve of 22 power points, which it could use to manifest each power once, or it could manifest the 4th-level power three times.",
    "benefit": "Choose one power you know of 8th level or lower. Your psicrystal can now manifest this power once per day at your manifester level (the psicrystal gains suffi cient power points to manifest the power once). You cannot bestow a power upon your psicrystal if the power normally has any experience point cost.",

In exchange, you gain an insight bonus on your melee attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round. The bonus on attack rolls equals the level of the spell sacrificed. The bonus on damage rolls is 1d6 points per level of the spell sacrificed, plus any extra damage based on your sneak attack ability. These bonuses apply against only one type of creature, depending on the type of spell sacrificed. If you sacrifice an arcane spell, they apply against constructs; if the sacrificed spell is divine, the bonuses apply against undead. Example: A 5th-level wizard/1st-level rogue activates this feat, sacrificing a prepared web spell. She gains a +2 insight bonus on her melee attack rolls against constructs for 1 round, and also adds 3d6 points of damage to successful attacks against constructs during that round (2d6 for the 2nd-level spell, plus 1d6 for her sneak attack damage).

    "benefit": "This feat expands the way you can use the Knowledge skills. It allows you to use a Knowledge skill to navigate a library, an offi ce fi ling system, a chronicler's repository, or a church's records storage cell in order to discover information. You must be able to read the language the texts are written in to research them. Research a Topic: Given enough time (usually 1d4 hours, though the DM can increase the time based on the amount of material you're examining) and a successful DC 10 skill check, you gain a general understanding of the topic you're researching. This assumes the information you are seeking exists within the collection of materials you are researching. The higher the check result, the better and more detailed the information (to the extent available within the source material). When you want to fi nd out specifi c information on a specifi c topic, you must fi rst fi nd a library with tomes relating to that topic. The quality of the library or collection can provide a circumstance bonus on your Knowledge check when performing research. General-purpose libraries (such as those found in some wealthy households, small churches, or towns) contain basic information on a variety of topics and provide a +1 circumstance bonus. A library devoted to a specifi c topic (usually owned by churches or organizations devoted to specifi c pursuits) provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Knowledge checks related to its topic. Comprehensive collections are harder to fi nd, but they provide a +4 circumstance bonus. Such collections reside with large churches, in some larger cities, in some organizations and institutions, at Morgrave University, and in major chronicle offi ces. Even rarer and harder to gain access to are master collections, which provide a +6 circumstance bonus. Master collections are found in a few dragonmarked house enclaves, one or two royal libraries, and in the library at Korranberg. Examine Records: Examining books or records to get a general sense of what's in them takes time, skill, and some luck. Find a stack of ledgers in the alchemist's lab? Discover records in the crime lord's hideout? Locate the fi les pertaining to taxes collected in the city? To get a general sense of the information contained therein and whether or not you can use it, you must make a research check using the most appropriate Knowledge skill. The DC depends on the complexity of the code or fi ling system used. Complexity. - knowledge - Time. of Code ----- DC ----------- Needed. Basic ------- 10 ------------ 1d4 hours. Simple ------ 15 ------------ 1d4+1 hours. Moderate --- 20 ----------- 1d4+2 hours. Complex ---- 30 ----------- 1d4+4 hours. On any successful check, the higher the result, the better and more complete the information you glean. If you start out seeking a specific fact, date, map, or similar bit of information, the DM might increase the DC by as little as +5 or as much as +15. You can retry a Knowledge check made to perform research, though if the material you are examining doesn't contain the data you seek, you can't find it. You can take 10 or take 20 when making a Knowledge check to research a topic or examine records. This use of the Knowledge skill takes a minimum of 1d4 hours.",

Enduring Potency: If you cast a spell from your daily allotment of spells, then cast the same spell from a scroll or wand in the next round, you can treat the second casting as if it had come from your daily allotment of spells for the purpose of caster level, save DC, and any other effect of the spell. For example, if Hennet the 10th-level sorcerer casts magic missile, then activates a wand of magic missile (caster level 5th) in the next round, he can treat the wand's magic missile as if he had cast it (giving him a greater range, number of missiles, and so forth). Lingering Metamagic: If you cast a spell affected by one or more metamagic feats, and then cast the same spell in the next round, you can apply any one of the metamagic effects from the first casting to the second casting, but without any change to the spell's level. The second spell doesn't count as being affected by a metamagic feat for the purpose of this benefit (that is, it doesn't entitle you to apply the metamagic feat to a spell you might cast in the following round). Only spells you cast using your own metamagic feats (as opposed to metamagic effects from magic items) allow this option to function. For example, if Hennet uses a 5th-level slot to cast an empowered lightning bolt, in the next round he can use a 3rdlevel slot to cast another empowered lightning bolt. If the first spell was a silent empowered lightning bolt, he could apply the effect of either Silent Spell or Empower Spell to the second casting of lightning bolt, but not both.",

Each participant cuts his hand. Everyone in the ritual then clasps hands in a circle while you stand in the middle. You speak a prayer while sprinkling holy or unholy water on each participant. This ritual grants a benefit to its participants (including you) when an ally falls in battle. If an individual who participated in this ritual sees another participant drop to 0 or fewer hit points due to an opponent's actions, he gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls against the foe who dropped his ally. The benefit lasts for 1 minute every time it is triggered. You can gain this bonus against multiple foes during the duration of the effect. This ritual requires 10 minutes of incantation, a vial of holy water or unholy water, and silver dust worth 10 gp. The ritual's benefits lasts for 24 hours.",

Sharran clerics require the subject to complete a dangerous quest before receiving the atonement, and afterward you must choose her as your patron. (The usual quest is to destroy a follower of Selune whose level is at least as high as yours.) If you later change your patron, you immediately suffer the Wisdom loss.

You can aim the split breath effects so that their areas overlap. Creatures caught in the area of overlap are struck by both weapons and are affected twice, subject to all the normal rules for stacking magical effects. When you use this feat, add +1 to the number of rounds you must wait before using your breath weapon again.",

When you activate this ability, as a free action, you immediately take at least 2 points of temporary Constitution damage. You can take as many points of Constitution damage as you wish, as long as you remain alive and conscious. Once you have activated your stigmata, you can touch your allies to heal them of 1 point of damage per level they possess for every 2 points of Constitution damage you take. In addition, any character you touch who is suffering from a disease can immediately make a new saving throw against that disease with a sacred bonus equal to the number of points of Constitution damage you took. If the character succeeds on that saving throw, she is freed from the disease. You can use this touch on one ally per point of Constitution damage you take. As with delivering a touch spell, you can touch up to six allies as a full-round action. A single person can only benefit once from each activation of your stigmata, but each activation lasts for 1 hour. For example, if you sacrifice 4 points of Constitution, you can grant four allies a number of hit points of healing equal to twice their level. Each ally who was suffering from a disease would make a new saving throw with a +4 sacred bonus. If only two of your allies were wounded at the time you activated the stigmata, you could &quot;save&quot; the other two uses for up to 1 hour, in case other characters become wounded within that time. Even if the characters you originally healed were injured again, however, they could not benefit from the same activation of your stigmata. When you use this ability, the wounds on your body bleed in proportion to the Constitution damage you take. The bleeding persists for 1 hour, and the Constitution damage cannot be restored by any means until the bleeding has stopped. Once the bleeding has stopped, you can freely activate the stigmata again, whether or not you have recovered your lost Constitution, as long as you have enough Constitution left to use the ability and survive.",

A stitched fl esh familiar is magically linked to its master in the same way as a normal familiar. A stitched fl esh familiar uses the basic statistics for a creature of its kind, as given in the Monster Manual, except as noted below. Hit Dice: A stitched fl esh familiar has a d12 Hit Die and gains no bonus hit points from Constitution (since it is an undead creature). For effects that depend upon Hit Dice, use the master's character level or the familiar's normal Hit Dice total, whichever is higher. Hit Points: Use 1/2 the master's total or the familiar's normal total, whichever is higher. Attacks: Use the master's base attack bonus or the familiar's, whichever is higher. Saving Throws: For each saving throw, use either the familiar's base save bonus or the master's (as calculated from his character level), whichever is higher. Familiar Special Abilities: Use the second table in the Familiars sidebar on page 52 of the Player's Handbook to determine additional abilities, just as you would for a normal familiar. Stitched fl esh familiars do not grant their masters any of the benefi ts that appear on the fi rst table in that sidebar. Instead of the noted special ability, a stitched fl esh familiar grants its master the ability to control 4 more Hit Dice of undead than he is normally capable of controlling (both through the rebuke undead ability and through spells such as animate dead).",

Creating a tattoo takes 1 hour, and it must be inked onto a creature with a corporeal body. When you create a tattoo, you set the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. The base price of a tattoo is its spell level Ã— its caster level Ã— 50 gp. To create a tattoo, you must spend 1/25th of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing half this base price. When you create a tattoo, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. The bearer of the tattoo is the only one who can activate it and is always the target of the spell. Activating a tattoo requires the creature to touch the tattoo with either hand (the hand does not need to be empty). Activating a tattoo is a standard action that does not draw an attack of opportunity. Any tattoo that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the tattoo. Normally, a magic tattoo uses a magic item space on the creature's body. For example, a creature with a tattoo on one of its hands could not gain the benefit from a magic glove on that hand. Likewise, a creature with a magic tattoo on its back does not receive the benefits of a magic cloak, cape, or mantle. In effect, the magic tattoo is always the first item &quot;worn&quot; on that part of the body, negating the effects of all other items. A tattoo can be created that does not use a magic item space, but the base price of such a tattoo is double the normal value. A magic tattoo can be erased with an erase spell as if it were magic writing. Failing to erase the tattoo does not activate it. When a tattoo is activated, the ink pattern or design vanishes from the bearer's skin.",

The image becomes more &quot;real&quot; as you advance in level. This ability is usable up to a maximum of 1 minute per level each day. The simulacrum combines the characteristics of the silent image (PH 279) and unseen servant (PH 297) spells. Its hit points are equal to 6 + your character level. It ignores terrain effects and moves like an unseen servant, making no noise in the process, though it makes normal motions while traveling. If you have a fly speed, the image appears to fly when not in contact with the ground; otherwise, it walks on open air. You can do anything with this image that you could do with the unseen servant spell and are under the same limitations. When you attain 5th level, you gain more control over the simulacrum. At this point, it behaves more like a major image spell (PH 252), though it still performs actions like an unseen servant. As long as the simulacrum remains within 5 feet of your position (and you can direct it to do so as a free action), you can perform a Bluff check in combat as a swift action. You gain a +4 bonus on this check, which is opposed by your opponents' Sense Motive checks. If you are successful, your foes believe the image is you (and vice versa) for 1 round. Once you reach 10th level, you can spend a swift action to transfer your perceptions to the simulacrum and perceive the world from its point of view rather than your own. You can move the image as if it were your own body, using the simulacrum's movement characteristics (ignoring terrain, &quot;flying,&quot; and the like). You can also perform any skill and ability checks using the simulacrum, as long as they do not require a Strength score higher than 2. The image has phantom versions of all your equipment (such as lockpicks), but any such items that lose direct contact with it immediately dissipate. When you attain 15th level, the image can become more &quot;real&quot; at your command. It gains a Strength score equal to one-half your own and can perform combat actions using phantom versions of your gear. Any of these items that lose contact with the image dissipate immediately. Thus, the image can wield a sword, but if it shoots a bow, the arrow disappears as soon as it is fired. Equipment that extends more than 5 feet from the image (such as a length of rope) also disappears beyond that distance. In addition, you can now cast spells originating from the image as if with a project image spell (PH 265), with one exception. If you lose line of effect to the image, the effect does not end; you just can't cast spells originating from the image until you gain line of effect again.",

Stair King: To use this maneuver, you must gain the high ground bonus on your attacks against an opponent. If you hit your foe with two or more melee attacks during your turn, he must make a Balance check (DC 10 + your Str modifier) or be knocked prone. Your opponent can opt to succeed automatically on his Balance check. If he does so, he will lose his move action on his next turn, but he will Succeed automatically on Balance checks to resist this maneuver until the start of his next turn. Your opponent must make this choice before seeing the result of his Balance check. You can target a particular creature with this maneuver once per round. Tunnel Fighter.- To use this maneuver, you must be the target of at least one melee attack from at least one foe while standing with walls adjacent to you on two or more sides. When you are attacked under such conditions, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class due to cover. (If you gain cover from another source, this benefit does not stack with it.) You also block line of sight for any spells or attacks made by your opponents, though your allies can fire through your space as normal. Door Sentinel: To use this maneuver, you must fight defensively while adjacent to or standing in a doorway, a gate, or a similar opening in a wall. You must be adjacent to or standing in each square across the doorway's width. For 1 round after you fight defensively, you gain a +4 bonus on Strength or Dexterity checks to resist bull rush or trip attacks. Any creature attempting a Tumble check to avoid your attack of opportunity takes a -5 penalty on the check. Any creature attempting to tumble through your space takes a -10 penalty on its check.",

The DC of this check is 10 + (the item's gp cost minus the community's gp limit, divided by 1,000). If this check succeeds, you learn of a merchant who can supply the item to you. You must still purchase it as normal. Intuitive Communication: When you are faced with a creature whose language you do not understand, you can attempt to communicate with it by making a successful Sense Motive check. This check requires that you spend at least 1 minute listening to the creature and watching its gestures and demeanor. The check's base DC is 20. If the creature is not the same type as you, the DC is 30. With a successful check, you learn the basic gist of the creature's speech. This ability gives you no special talent to speak the creature's tongue. Social Agility: You can temporarily alter a creature's attitude toward you. You can use Bluff against an unfriendly or less hostile creature in the same way you use Diplomacy. Using Bluff in this manner is a standard action that takes no special penalties. The target's attitude remains changed for 1 minute. After this time, it becomes one grade more hostile than where it started for 10 minutes.",

This ability allows the shifter to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. A wildhunt shifter can identify familiar odors just as a human does familiar sights. A wildhunt shifter can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. These stronger scents block other scents, so they can sometimes be used to confuse or hamper this shifter trait. When a wildhunt shifter detects a scent, the exact location of the source i sn't rev ealed--only i ts presence somewhere within range. The shifter can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the shifter comes within 5 feet of the source, she pinpoints the source's location. While shifting, a wildhunt shifter who has the Track feat can follow tracks by smell, making Survival checks to fi nd or follow a trail. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (regardless of the surface that holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry's odor is, the number of creatures producing the odor, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail grows cold, the DC increases by 2. This ability otherwise follows the rules for the Track feat. Shifters tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility. When not shifting, a wildhunt shifter gains a +2 bonus on Survival checks due to the lingering effects of the scent ability.",

If you resist: fhree consecutive attempts by a possessing fiend to control your body, you can make an attempt to seize control of its abilities instead- Make a special level check (ld20 + your character level + your Cha modifier) against a DC of 10 * the fiend's HD + the liend's Cha modifier. If you succeed on this check, the fiend loses access to your senses. Furthermore, if your level equals or exceeds the fiend's HD, you also gain control over all the fiend's extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities that don't depend on its physical form. You can activate those powers on your turn as if they were your own. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus. When this control lapses, you cannot attempt to assert control again unless you again resist three consecutive control attempts by that fiend.",
