You do not, however, gain any other<br />benefi t a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming an abolisher, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.",
      "favored enemy (ex)": "At 1st level, your hatred of aberrations grants you a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against aberrations. Likewise, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. At 4th level, and then again at 8th level, this bonus increases by 2. If you possess the favored enemy (aberrations) feature from another source, these bonuses stack.",
      "wild shape (su)": "You gain the druid ability to use wild shape once per day. Your abolisher wild shape is somewhat more limited than a full druid&#39;s wild shape ability, though, and you are limited to Medium animals. The ability otherwise works as detailed on page 37 of the Player&#39;s Handbook. As you gain levels, you gain additional uses of this ability per day. At 4th level, you can use wild shape two times per day, and at 8th level you can do so three times per day. If you already have wild shape uses from another class, such as druid, these wild shape uses stack. If you have druid levels, each time you gain a level of abolisher, you add 1 to your effective druid level to determine the maximum Hit Dice of a creature you can wild shape into and how long each use of wild shape lasts. The type and size of animal that you can wild shape into does not improve from abolisher levels.",
      "animal companion": "If you have an animal companion, your abolisher levels stack with your previous class levels (usually druid or ranger) to determine the animal companion&#39;s abilities. If you do not already have an animal companion, you do not gain one from this ability.",
      "winds of nature&#39;s grace (ex)": "At 2nd level and higher, you gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws made against attacks from aberrations. The bonus increases to match your Charisma bonus, if any (minimum of +2) when you use wild shape or other magic to assume the form of an animal, elemental, or plant.",
      "pierce aberrant defense (ex)": "Many aberrations possess some degree of spell resistance, and abolishers train to overcome this spell resistance. Beginning at 3rd level, you gain a +1 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome an aberration&#39;s spell resistance. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level, and then to +3 at 9th level. These bonuses stack with those granted by the Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration feats.",
      "crystals of nature&#39;s wrath (su)": "At 5th level and higher, your wild shape natural attacks are enhanced with jagged crystals. These crystals are harmless to most creatures, but to aberrations they cause terrible welts and acidlike burns. An aberration struck by one of your natural weapons must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + abolisher level + Cha modifi er) or become sickened for 1 minute. An aberration that makes its saving throw is immune to this effect for the duration of that use of wild shape.",
      "waves of nature&#39;s purity (su)": "Beginning at 7th level, you can create a rippling aura of white vapor that spreads in a 20-foot radius. The vapor does not obscure vision, and it is cool and refreshing against the skin of nonaberrations. Against aberrations, the waves of nature&#39;s purity are foul and unsettling. An affected aberration must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + abolisher level + Cha modifi er) each round or become nauseated for that round. You can use this ability once per day, and the power lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifi er (minimum 1 round). Activating this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.",
      "fires of nature&#39;s rage (su)": "A 10th level, you can infuse your wild shape form with fl ickering ghostly fi re three times per day. The fi res of nature&#39;s rage burn any aberration that comes in contact with them. Your natural attacks do an extra 3d6 points of fi re damage against aberrations, and an aberration that hits you, even with a weapon, takes 3d6 points of fire damage. You can activate the fires of nature&#39;s wrath as a free action, as long as you are in wild shape form. Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each activation lasts for 1 round."

While flying in a straight line (using a full-round action), the aerial avenger can move her speed, making a melee attack at any foe within reach on her path. For each foe attacked beyond the first, each attack suffers a -1 attack penalty, so the aerial avenger must declare how many foes she attacks before she starts (minimum two). The aerial avenger gives up her regular attacks to take this action. This is an extraordinary ability that draws no attacks of opportunity, even if the aerial avenger passes through threatened areas on her way through the swoop.",

      "attraction (sp)": "An ancient master can plant a compelling attraction in the mind of any subject within 25 feet of her. The attraction can be toward a particular person, object, action, or event. The target takes all reasonable steps to get close to the person, find the object, attend the event, or perform the action designated, though it does not suffer from blind obsession and does not take extreme risks to do so. The subject can recognize danger but does not flee unless the threat is immediate. If the ancient master specifies herself as the object of the attraction, she cannot command the subject indiscriminately, though the subject does listen to her (even if it disagrees). This ability grants the ancient master a +4 bonus on Charisma checks made to influence the subject for the duration of the effect. Attraction lasts for 1 hour. This ability is usable once per day at 1st level and an additional once per day every three ancient master levels thereafter (twice per day at 4th level, three times per day at 7th level, and four times per day at 10th level). This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.",

She gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against divination effects that reveal emotions or thoughts and a +20 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks made to oppose Sense Motive checks. This ability is always active.",
      "body equilibrium (ex)": "A 3rd-level or higher ancient master can adjust her body density to match that of any solid or liquid she stands on. Thus, she can walk on water, quicksand, or even a spider&#39;s web without sinking or breaking through. (This ability does not confer any resistance to particularly sticky webs.) She can move at her normal speed, but she cannot run on an unfirm surface without sinking or breaking through. If she falls while using this ability, damage from the impact is halved. This ability is usable at will.",
      "levitate (sp)": "Upon reaching 4th level, an ancient master can use <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/levitate--2830/\">levitate</a> (caster level equals ancient master level) once per day. She gains one additional use per day of this ability at 7th level and another at 10th level.",

      "shadow concealment (su)": "At 6th level, an ancient master gains the ability to take on shadow form for 1 minute per ancient master level. While in this state, she becomes incorporeal, appearing as a shadowy image of herself. She gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks while this ability is in effect. The ancient master gains one additional use per day of this ability at 9th level.",
      "baleful teleport (sp)": "At 7th level, an ancient master can disperse miniscule portions of a target creature or object weighing no more than 300 pounds. The target takes 9d6 points of damage from this attack. A successful Will save (DC 10 + ancient master level + ancient master&#39;s Cha modifier) halves the damage. A target under a dimensional anchor effect is immune to baleful teleport. This ability is usable once per day at 7th level and twice per day at 10th level. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.",
      "claws of the vampire (sp)": "When an ancient master reaches 8th level, she can cause the fingers on both her hands (if she has any) to grow to wicked, 2-inch-long points. She gains a claw attack (base damage 1d8 points) that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Whenever she uses this attack, she heals one-half the base damage that she deals with claws of the vampire. She can use this ability in conjunction with feats, abilities, or spells that allow additional attacks in the same round. This effect lasts for 1 hour per ancient master level and can be used once <br />per day. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.",
      "mind probe (sp)": "Once per day, a 9th-level or higher ancient master can read the thoughts of any one living creature within 30 feet that fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + ancient master level + ancient master&#39;s Cha modifier). All the target&#39;s memories and knowledge are accessible to her, from memories deep below the surface to those easily called to mind. She can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the target&#39;s knowledge. She can also probe a sleeping target, though it may make a Will save (DC 10 + ancient master level + ancient master&#39;s Cha modifier) to wake after each question. Targets that do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the ability&#39;s range unless somehow hindered. The ancient master poses the questions telepathically<br />and the answers are imparted directly to her mind. She and the target do not need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate visual images in answer to her questions. Creatures protected by mind blank are immune to this ability. Mind probe lasts for 1 minute per ancient master level. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.",
      "disintegrate (sp)": "A 10th-level ancient master can use <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/disintegrate--2801/\">disintegrate</a> (caster level 10th) once per day."

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an arachnomancer, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.",

      "student of perfection</strong>: arcanopaths are monks, although they meditate on alternative methods of achieving physical enlightenment. as such, an arcanopath monk gains flurry of blows, unarmed damage, ac bonus, and unarmored speed as if he were a monk whose level equaled his monk level + his arcanopath monk level. for instance, a 6th-level monk/1st-level arcanopath has a base flurry ofblows attack bonus of +4/+4 (as if he were a 7th-level monk). those who manage to meet the requirements for this class who are not monks gain these abilities as if a monk equal to only their arcanopath monk level.</p><p><strong>clap of deafness (su)": "The monk can use this supernatural ability once per round, but no more than once per arcanopath level per day. The monk must declare he is using the clap of deafness before making the attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). A foe struck by the arcanopath is forced to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + the arcanopath level + the arcanopath&#39;s Wisdom modifier), in addition to taking damage as normal If the saving throw fails, the opponent is deafened for 1 round. A deafened character has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components (as well as suffering a -4 penalty on initiative checks and an inability to make Listen checks). Unless specified to the contrary, all spell failure penalties stack. Creatures immune to critical hits or sonic attacks cannot be affected by the arcanopath&#39;s clap.",

The monk must declare he is using the strike of confusion before making the attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). A foe struck by the arcanopath is forced to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + the arcanopath level + the arcanopath&#39;s Wisdom modifier), in addition to taking damage as normal. If the saving throw fails, the opponent has a 50% chance of spell failure when casting any spell (or attempting to use a spell-like ability) for 2d4 rounds.

The arcanopath must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this ability. Once per round when the arcanopath would normally be hit with a ray or energy missile spell the character can make a DC 20 Reflex saving throw (if the ray or energy missile has a magical bonus to attack, the DC increases by that amount). If the arcanopath succeeds, he deflects the spell. The arcanopath must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ray or energy missile doesn&#39;t count as an action.",

If the saving throw fails, the opponent loses 1d4 arcane spells (or 1d4 unused daily arcane spell slots). The lost spells or spell slots are lost first from the highest level spells the spellcaster can cast, but otherwise are determined by the creature struck. If the result indicates more spells lost than are prepared (or unused) at a particular level, spells at the next lower level are lost in the same fashion, and so on. Lost spells (or open spell slots) can be regained normally. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected by the slap of forgetfulness.",

Reflect Spell (Su): Starting at 9th level, when an arcanopath monk successfully deflects a spell he can choose to reflect it back at the caster. An arcanopath can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day). A reflected spell is, in effect, cast back on the original caster, although the monk rerolls any necessary attack roll (associated DCs<br />are unchanged).",
      "sundering strike of oblivion (ex)": "When an arcanopath monk of 10th level makes a successful slap of forgetfulness, he can automatically convert it to a sundering strike of oblivion once per day. In addition to taking normal damage and losing 1d4 prepared arcane spells (or 1d4 unused daily arcane spell slots), the foe completely loses knowledge of the lost spells. Spellcasters who lose knowledge of spells may later attempt a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level + the arcanopath&#39;s Wisdom modifier) to regain each one. Failure indicates the spell is unavailable until the next time the spellcaster advances a level, at which time the spellcaster automatically relearns all her forgotten spells (as well as gains knowledge of new spells as normal for the class)."

      "ashworm mount (ex)": "You have the service of a loyal ashworm that serves you as a mount. Unlike the ashworms sold as regular mounts, this ashworm&#39;s poison stinger is not clipped. Moreover, it never tries to submerge when it reaches open sand, as ashworms sold as mounts do. Finally, your ashworm serves readily as a combat steed. To ride your mount, you need special tack, harness, and an exotic saddle, all of which costs 70 gp.",
      "saddle bonus (ex)": "You gain a competence bonus equal to your class level on all Handle Animal and Ride checks associated with your ashworm while you are mounted.",
      "bonus feat": "At 2nd and 9th level, you can choose a bonus feat from the fighter bonus feats given in the Player&#39;s Handbook.",
      "heightened sting (ex)": "Wild ashworms, and ashworms chosen as mounts by dragoon characters, have a poisonous stinger (normal saddle-broken ashworms sold as mounts have their stinger clipped for the rider&#39;s safety). At 3rd level and higher, you can induce your mount to make a heightened sting attack in conjunction with your regular attacks that round. When making a heightened sting attack, the ashworm&#39;s attack roll modifier is equal to your base attack bonus + the ashworm&#39;s Str modifier. On a successful hit, the victim&#39;s Fortitude save DC to resist the poison is 10 + 1/2 your character level + the ashworm&#39;s Con modifier. This is a special attack, and it can be made only once per round, and a total number of times per day equal to your class level.",
      "relentless shield (ex)": "At 4th level and higher, you can make a Ride check after any attack that successfully strikes your ashworm mount, in an attempt to negate the hit on your ashworm. Normally, the Mounted Combat feat allows you to make this attempt only once per round. See the Mounted Combat feat, page 98 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>, for details. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Ride checks made to negate an opponent&#39;s attack roll. This ability does not extend to any other type of mount.",
      "stamp into the sand (ex)": "At 5th level, you gain Trample as a bonus feat. Instead of using a hoof, the ashworm makes one sting attack against the knocked down target. If you already have the Trample feat (or gain it later), you gain an extra benefit: When mounted on your ashworm, a foe you have knocked down using Trample is so thoroughly flattened that rising from a prone position requires a full-round action instead of a move action. ",
      "sand rider (su)": "Upon reaching 6th level, you have formed such a close bond with your mount that you are able to stay with the ashworm when it travels beneath the sand. During these trips, you have learned the trick of tightening your harness, just so, while at the same time guiding your sandswimming mount in an expert manner that allows you to cling to the ashworm&#39;s back without being swept off, and without fear of suffocation. This ability does not allow you to remain attached when the ashworm burrows through solid earth (but see the earth rider class feature, below), and you can travel in this manner for 1 minute per class level at a time before you and your mount must surface for air. ",
      "full mounted attack (ex)": "Beginning at 7th level, you can make a full attack when your mount moves more than 5 feet but no farther than its speed as a single move action. You cannot combine this full attack with a charge action.",
      "spirited worm (ex)": "You gain Spirited Charge as a bonus feat at 8th level. If you already have Spirited Charge (or gain it later), you gain an extra benefit: When mounted on your ashworm and using the charge action, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage (or 2d6 with a lance). This ability does not extend to any other type of mount. ",
      "earth rider (su)": "At 10th level, your bond with your mount is so close that you are able to stay with the ashworm even when it travels beneath packed earth. During these trips, you have learned the trick of quickly adjusting your harness, while at the same time guiding your burrowing mount in an expert manner that allows you to cling to the ashworm&#39;s back without being swept off, and without fear of suffocation. You can travel in this manner for 1 minute per class level at a time before you and your mount must surface for air. An ashworm cannot burrow through solid rock. If it is forced to stop burrowing (such as if it is slain) while you are on its back, you are subject to the normal hazards of being buried alive."

      "bloody murder (ex)": "Starting at 5th level, if you deal enough damage with a melee attack to drop a creature (typically by reducing it to below 0 hit points or killing it), all enemies within 30 feet of you who can see the target become frightened for 1 round. A successful Will save (DC 10 + your avenging executioner level + your Cha modifier) lessens the effect to shaken. Creatures whose HD exceed your character level are not affected. Bloody murder is a mind-affecting fear ability."

This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian&#39;s speed because of any load carried or armor worn. For example, a human barbarian has a speed of 40 feet, rather than 30 feet, when wearing light or no armor. When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 30 feet. A halfling barbarian has a speed of 30 feet, rather than 20 feet, in light or no armor. When wearing medium armor or carrying a medium load, his speed drops to 20 feet.",

      "trap sense (ex)": "Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian has an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.",

This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.",
      "damage reduction (ex)": "At 7th level, a barbarian gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from each blow or attack. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.",

      "indomitable will (ex)": "While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.",

She uses the captivating and confusing movements of the battle dance to evade her foes&#39; attacks. In addition, a battle dancer gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five battle dancer levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level). This bonus reflects the battle dancer&#39;s intense training in unarmed and unarmored combat.",
      "unarmed strike": "A battle dancer uses unarmed strikes in a manner similar to a monk. She can land a blow with her fist that has the same power as an axe stroke. At 1st level, the battle dancer gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat.",
      "dance of reckless bravery (su)": "A 2nd-level battle dancer with 5 ranks in Tumble gains the ability to inspire bravery in her allies. All ofthe battle dancer&#39;s allies within 30 feet of her gain a +4 bonus on saves against fear effects for a number of rounds equal to 5 + the battle dancer&#39;s Charisma modifier. The battle dancer can use this ability only when she is within an opponent&#39;s threatened area. It requires a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.",
      "bonus speed (ex)": "The battle dancer moves with speed and agility earned through countless hours of practice, physical training, and study of the precise, fluid movements of her battle dances. She gains a +10- foot bonus to speed at 4th level. She gains additional +10-foot bonuses at 10th level and 16th level.",
      "dance of the vexing snake (su)": "A 5th-level battle dancer with 8 ranks in Tumble gains the ability to dodge her opponent&#39;s blows with her sudden, unpredictable maneuvers. She can use the Tumble skill to move at her normal speed without penalty, and she can Tumble a distance up to her current speed.",
      "dancer&#39;s strike (su)": "The magic of the battle dancer&#39;s arcane maneuvers allows her to manifest auras of energy around her feet and hands. These auras can defeat an opponent&#39;s damage reduction. The battle dancer can generate this aura as a standard action at will. It persists for a number of rounds equal to 5 + the battle dancer&#39;s Charisma modifier before it fades.",
      "dance of the floating step (su)": "The battle dancer moves with such grace and speed that she can dance across water. An 8th-level battle dancer with 11 ranks in Tumble can cross the surface of a liquid, such as water or magma, without taking damage or sinking below the surface. If she ends her movement on such a liquid, she takes damage and sinks as normal. The battle dancer must begin her movement on a stable, firm surface.",
      "dance of the springing tiger (su)": "An 11th-level battle dancer with 14 ranks in Tumble can spring upon an opponent with the ferocity of a tiger. When charging, she can attempt a DC 20 Tumble check. If she succeeds, she may make a full attack rather than a standard attack as part of her charge.",
      "dance of the crushing python (su)": "The battle dancer&#39;s speed and mighty unarmed strikes combine to make her a fearsome opponent. She can step into an opponent&#39;s reach and confuse it with a series of feints and quick blows, distracting it from other threats. A 14th-level battle dancer with 17 ranks in Tumble can rain a series of hammering blows upon a foe. She must use the Tumble skill to enter her opponent&#39;s space without provoking an attack of opportunity. If she succeeds, she may then attack her opponent while in its space. If the battle dancer&#39;s attack hits, her opponent takes a -2 penalty to AC and it cannot make attacks of opportunity until the start of the battle dancer&#39;s next action. After the battle dancer completes her attack, she enters a square of her choice adjacent to the target.",
      "dance of the soaring eagle (su)": "A 17th-level battle dancer with 20 ranks in Tumble gains a fly speed equal to her base land speed with average maneuverability. If a flying battle dancer charges an opponent below her, she gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 bonus on damage in place of the normal benefits of charging. She may use her dance of the springing tiger in conjunction with an aerial charge.",
      "dance of death&#39;s embrace (su)": "A 20th-level battle dance with 23 ranks in Tumble can perform a vicious, deadly dance to defeat her opponent. Before using this dance, the battle dancer selects a single target within 30 feet. As a full-round action, the battle dancer performs an elaborate dance that requires a DC 35 Tumble check to complete. If she succeeds, any time she makes a successful attack against her designated target she deals +2d6 points of damage. In addition, any critical threat the battle dancer makes against her designated target is automatically confirmed as a critical hit. This ability lasts until the end of the battle dancer&#39;s next turn."

She makes a Ride check (DC = damage dealt) and, if she&#39;s successful, she takes only half damage from the blow.

To do so, the bloodhound must focus on a foe who is present and visible, or on the depiction or description of one who is not, for 10 minutes. Any interruption ruins the attempt and forces the bloodhound to start the process again. Once this study is complete, that target is called a mark. ",
      "swift tracker (ex)": "A bloodhound can move at his normal speed while following tracks. See the ranger class feature, page 48 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>.",
      "nonlethal force (ex)": "Starting at 2nd level, a bloodhound can use a melee weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage instead without taking the usual &#8212;4 penalty on his attack roll.",
      "ready and waiting (ex)": "Beginning at 2nd level, a bloodhound is ready for trickery at all times. He can ready an action against his mark, even outside of the initiative sequence. If the mark triggers the bloodhound&#39;s readied action at any point within the next 10 minutes, the bloodhound can carry out his readied action as if the two were engaged in combat (as long as the bloodhound is capable of carrying out that action). If the bloodhound is incapable of carrying out the action&#8212;for instance, if he is too far away to strike the mark with a readied melee attack&#8212;the readied action is lost.",
      "bring &#39;em back alive (ex)": "At 3rd level and higher, a bloodhound can turn a potentially killing blow into an incapacitating one&#8212;all the better to bring a mark back for punishment. At the bloodhound&#39;s option, any melee attack that would reduce a foe to &#8212;2 or fewer hit points reduces the foe to &#8212;1 hit points instead. A bloodhound must choose to use this ability immediately upon reducing his foe to &#8212;2 or fewer hit points, and before making any other action (or even continuing a full attack). A raging bloodhound can&#39;t use this ability.",
      "tenacious pursuit (ex)": "At 3rd level and above, a bloodhound tracking a mark gains a +4 bonus on Constitution checks made to resist nonlethal damage from a forced march (see page 164 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>). In addition, a bloodhound tracking a mark can increase his own speed by 10 feet, up to a maximum value equal to the mark&#39;s speed. This bonus stacks with all other speed increases. At 6th level, the speed increase improves to 20 feet, and it goes up to 30 feet at 9th level.",

      "move like the wind (ex)": "Starting at 4th level, a bloodhound can move stealthily even at a quick pace. He no longer takes a &#8212;5 penalty on Hide and Move Silently checks when moving at any speed up to his normal speed, and he takes only a &#8212;10 penalty (instead of a &#8212;20 penalty) on Hide and Move Silently checks when running. (He takes the normal &#8212;20 penalty when attacking or charging.)",
      "crippling strike (ex)": "Starting at 5th level, a bloodhound can deliver strikes against his mark with such precision that each successful attack also deals 2 points of Strength damage to the mark. A bloodhound can deliver a crippling strike with a melee attack, or with a ranged wind attack from a distance of up to 30 feet. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook.</em>",
      "track the trackless (su)": "Starting at 5th level, a bloodhound can track a creature moving under the<br />influence of <em>pass without trace</em> or a similar effect, though he takes a &#8212;20 penalty on his Survival checks when doing so.",
      "see invisibility (su)": "This ability, gained at 6th level, functions like a <em>see invisibility</em> spell, except that it is constantly in effect and it reveals only invisible marks.",
      "shielded mind (su)": "At 6th level, a bloodhound gains spell resistance against divination spells equal to 15 + his bloodhound level. This benefit does not stack with other forms of spell resistance.",
      "locate creature (sp)": "Once per day, a bloodhound of 7th level or higher can produce an effect identical to that of a <em>locate creature</em> spell with a caster level equal to the bloodhound&#39;s character level.",
      "freedom of movement (su)": "Starting at 8th level, a bloodhound can act normally regardless of magical effects that impede movement, as if he were affected by a <em>freedom of movement</em> spell. The effect lasts for a total time per day of 1 round per point of Wisdom bonus he possesses (minimum 1 round). The effect occurs automatically as soon as it is applied, lasts until it runs out or is no longer needed, and can be used multiple times per day (up to the total daily limit of rounds). The character&#39;s caster level is equal to his bloodhound level.",

This extra damage increases by +1d6 points evert four levels (+2d6 at 5th level and +3d6 at 9th level) Should the cancer mage score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. ",
      "disease host (ex)": "At 1st level, a cancer mage suffers no ill effects of diseases, except for purely cosmetic ones such as boils, pockmarks, watery eyes, blackened skin, hair loss, foul smell, and so on. The cancer mage becomes a carrier of every disease he encounters, though he remains immune to most of their effects. However, the cancer mage takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level if someone casts a cure disease spell or effect on him (he can make a Fortitude save to try to resist the effect). Furthermore, if the cancer mage has a cancerous companion (see below), he loses all abilities gained from the companion for 1d10 days after being the subject of a cure disease spell.",
      "cancerous companion (ex)": "At 2nd level, a cancer grows within the cancer mage, forming a large tumor. This cancerous growth gains intelligence and a personality distinct from the cancer mage. The companion and the cancer mage can communicate telepathically. When needed, the cancerous companion uses the cancer mage&#39;s scores for saves, ability scores other than Intelligence, and so forth. The cancerous companion gains abilities as the cancer mage gains levels.",

Only a 3rd-level or higher cancer mage can wear this armor and gain these benefits; other wearers treat it as padded armor. This armor is considered masterwork quality and can be fashioned into magic armor.",
      "children of the night (su)": "A 4th-level cancer mage commands the lesser creatures of the world and can call forth a swarm of 2d6 Small monstrous spiders or a pack of 4d8 dire rats or a swarm of 10d10 bats, once per day, as a stan- dard action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the cancer mage (understanding his mental commands) for up to 10 minutes per class level.",
      "viral agent (su)": "At 5th level, a cancer mage befriends a disease or virus that infests his body. He supernaturally enhances a disease, making it smarter by giving it a point of his own Intelligence. He establishes a telepathic link with the disease that functions at a range of one mile per class level of the cancer mage.",
      "insect armor (su)": "By allowing insects and worms to crawl over his body, a 7th-level cancer mage gains a +4 natural armor bonus. The cancer mage cannot wear armor heavier than light armor and keep this benefit, however.",
      "viral ally (su)": "In a fashion similar to the viral agent ability, a cancer mage of 8th level or higher can create a viral ally by devoting 3 points of Intelligence to a disease or virus in his system. The cancer mage can then bestow his viral ally upon a humanoid victim using his contagion ability, and the viral ally can communicate telepathically with the cancer mage. The viral ally (and thus the cancer mage) controls its host as surely as with a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dominate-person--2547/\"><em>dominate person</em></a> spell, although the host gets no separate saving throw to avoid the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dominate-person--2547/\">_ dominate person_</a> effect. The viral ally is a normal disease, however, and the victim can fight it off with successful Fortitude saves or a cure disease spell, either of which kills the viral ally. The cancer mage regains his missing Intelligence points 24 hours later. A cancer mage can create as many viral allies as he is willing to devote Intelligence points toward.",
      "disease form (su)": "At 10th level, a cancer mage gains the ability to tranform into a disease once per day. (This ability also affects up to 100 pounds of gear the cancer mage is carrying, plus tatterdemalion armor, insect armor, and a cancerous companion.) As a disease, the cancer mage is intangible and invisible to standard methods of observation, even blindsight. Creatures with the scent ability note a foulness in the air. The cancer mage cannot move, except with the wind (if any), or within a host."

As a result, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, and Jump checks in natural subterranean surroundings.",
      "underdark affinity (ex)": "At 2nd level, your adaptation to the Underdark allows you to use your nature-themed class abilities in natural subterranean surroundings as well. These include the druid and ranger abilities of camouflage, hide in plain sight, trackless step, and woodland stride. If you already have wild empathy, you can now use it to affect vermin. If you have the wild shape ability, add vermin to the types of creatures you can become (subject to all the size and frequency limitations provided by that ability). If you do not already have these underlying abilities, Underdark affinity does not grant them to you; it only augments those you already have.",
      "hide of stone (ex)": "As you gain levels in the cavestalker class, your body embraces the rigors of the Underdark and takes on something of its hue and toughness. Your skin hardens and becomes flinty, granting you a natural armor bonus in addition to a circumstance bonus on Hide checks when in natural subterranean surroundings. These bonuses increase as you progress through the cavestalker class, at 6th level and again at 10th level.",
      "lesser cavesense (ex)": "At 3rd level, you are gifted with a mystical connection to the Underdark, giving you darkvision out to 120 feet. If you already have darkvision out to 120 feet, your darkvision extends an additional 60 feet. Due to your familiarity with the acoustic qualities of the Underdark, you also gain a +4 competence bonus on Listen checks made in subterranean surroundings.",
      "exotic combat style (ex)": "At 4th level, you gain mastery of a specific exotic combat style, either the spiked chain style or the hand crossbow style.",
      "expert spelunker (ex)": "Upon reaching 5th level, your familiarity with the tight confines of the Underdark allows you to retain your Dexterity bonus even when climbing or when in a cramped space. Furthermore, you&#39;re better able to negotiate cramped spaces, lowering Escape Artist DCs, move penalties, and attack penalties by one category.",
      "gaseous form (sp)": "At 6th level, you gain the ability to traverse the treacherous and confined terrain of the Underdark by assuming <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/gaseous-form--2819/\">gaseous form</a> once per day (caster level 12th).",
      "improved exotic combat style (ex)": "Your aptitude for your chosen exotic combat style increases at 7th level. If you do not already have a combat style from the ranger class, then the improved exotic combat style grants you one of those ranger combat styles. If you already have the hand crossbow exotic combat style, you must select archery; if you already have the spiked chain exotic combat style, you must choose two-weapon combat.",
      "greater cavesense (ex)": "When you reach 8th level, your mystical connection to the Underdark increases, granting you tremorsense out to 30 feet.",
      "void in space (su)": "When you reach 9th level, your attunement to the particular atmosphere of the Underdark allows you to warp the sounds, scents, and vibrations you give off, making you invisible to creatures that rely on senses other than sight to detect others. This effectively makes you undetectable to blindsense, blindsight, and tremorsense. You still make noises and vibrations (though a successful Move Silently check can mask the sounds), but creatures that cannot see are incapable of determining your true location and believe that you are 30 feet in a random direction from where you are actually located.",
      "master spelunker (su)": "By the time you reach 10th level, your affinity for the terrain of the Underdark has become so great that you can negotiate it without difficulty and even merge with it at times. This grants you the ability to use <em>spider climb</em> (as the spell) on any natural stone surface at will. In addition, you can use <em>meld into stone</em> (as the spell) with any surface of unworked stone three times per day."

      "spells": "At each even-numbered level gained in the Cerebrex class, a character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of rebuking or controlling undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a Cerebrex, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.",
      "enigma&#39;s bane (ex)": "A Cerebrex knows the way to the heart of any mystery. When confronted by a puzzle, enigma, code, or riddle, she gains a circumstance bonus equal to her cerebrex level to any Intelligence checks or Intelligence-based skill checks necessary to solve it.",
      "scent (su)": "At 2nd level, the cerebrex gains the scent ability (Monster Manual, page 314).",
      "aggression mastery (su)": "At this point in her development, the 3rd-level cerebrex has mastered the areas of the brain responsible for aggression. Once per day, as a standard action, the cerebrex may either cause herself or another creature to enter a rage (as a barbarian), or alternatively to force a barbarian out of a rage. Non-barbarians rage as a 1st-level barbarian, while barbarians rage as normal. The cerebrex must touch the creature, which provokes an attack of opportunity, to use this ability. An unwilling target can make a Will save (DC 10+one-half cerebrex level+Charisma bonus) to negate the effect.",
      "symphony of nerves (su)": "A 4th-level cerebrex&#39;s neural networks are now highly sensitized. Once per day, as a free action, she gains an enhancement bonus to Dexterity equal to one-half her cerebrex level. This effect lasts one round per cerebrex level.",
      "blindsense (ex)": "At 5th level, the cerebrex&#39;s heightening senses grant her blindsense to 30 feet.<br />Telepathic Immunity (Su): A Cerebrex of 5th level is immune to all forms of telepathy or mind reading. She may suppress and reactivate this immunity at will, as a free action.",
      "eidetic memory (ex)": "At 6th level, the Cerebrex reaches the next level of her evolution: memory. She has perfect recall of events in all five senses. This grants her a competence bonus on all Intelligence checks and Intelligence-based skill checks equal to half her cerebrex levels.",
      "clairaudience/clairvoyance (sp)": "By concentrating for 1 minute, a 7th-level Cerebrex may expand her senses to such an extent that she can perceive an unseen area as per the clairaudience/clairvoyance spell. This ability is as the spell of the same name, as cast by a sorcerer of the cerebrex&#39;s class level.",
      "blindsight (ex)": "An 8th-level cerebrex gains blindsight to 60 feet (Monster Manual, page 306).",
      "twist the neural skein (su)": "The 9th-level Cerebrex knows the neural &quot;shapes&quot; of spells in her own mind so well that she can sense the traces of memorized spells in the minds of her opponents and tear them from their minds. Twice per day, as a standard action, a Cerebrex can watch a known spellcaster and attempt to determine a spell that caster still has prepared. She must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level + opponent&#39;s Intelligence modifier) to uncover a spell. The amount the check result exceeds this DC determines the highest level of spell she can find. She knows one randomly determined prepared spell of the appropriate level (or lower). The cerebrex chooses the spell level she wishes to investigate after making her check.",
      "neural glimpse (su)": "The cerebrex can detect minute indicators of a humanoid&#39;s intended actions even as that being becomes aware of them. In combat, this translates into an insight bonus to AC equal to the cerebrex&#39;s Intelligence modifier. Outside of combat, the cerebrex gains an insight bonus equal to her Intelligence modifier (minimum +1) on Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks. She may use this ability once per day for a number of rounds equal to her cerebrex class level.",
      "inscrutable mind (su)": "Also at 10th level, the cerebrex has become so aware of her own mind that she gains a +4 bonus on all saves made against mind-affecting, fear, and sleep effects. In addition, whenever a cerebrex makes a saving throw against an illusion, she gains a circumstance bonus equal to her Intelligence bonus."

A cloud anchorite must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but she can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. She cannot use the run action while climbing. She retains her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against her while she is climbing. A cloud anchorite in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed. As the cloud anchorite gains levels, her climb speed increases. At each odd-numbered level, she gains a +10-foot bonus to her current climb speed. If the cloud anchorite already possesses a climb speed (for example, if she possessed a racial climb speed before becoming a cloud anchorite), these bonuses stack with her current climb speed.",

She can hold her breath twice as long as normal, and gains a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws against inhaled poisons, fatigue caused by high elevation, and altitude sickness. At 6th level, her bonus on these Fortitude saving throws increases to +6.",
      "bonus feat": "At 3rd level and again at 7th level, a cloud anchorite gains a bonus feat. This feat must be selected from the following list, and she must qualify for any prerequisites the feat to be chosen might require: Acrobatic, Agile, Athletic, Cold Endurance, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Improved Cold Endurance, Self-Sufficient, Skill Focus (in any class skill), or Track.",
      "resistance to cold (su)": "At 4th level, a cloud anchorite gains resistance to cold 5. This increases to resistance to cold 10 at 8th level.",
      "fast movement (ex)": "At 4th level, a cloud anchorite gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to her land speed. A cloud anchorite in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed. At 8th level, this bonus increases to +20 feet.",
      "empty stride (su)": "At 5th level, a cloud anchorite&#39;s stride is nearly weightless. She gains a +4 bonus on all Balance checks. More impressively, she can walk on the surface of any material into which she would normally sink, such as powdery snow, thin ice, and even water. She may continue to walk on this surface as long as she makes a DC 15 Concentration check. Normally, the Concentration check for this activity is a standard action, so a cloud anchorite may make one move action per round while using her empty stride ability. If she makes a DC 30 Concentration check, she may concentrate on her Empty Stride ability as a move action instead, allowing her to use it and still take one standard action in a round. She does not trigger traps that use pressure plates while using empty stride, nor is her speed impacted by deep snow.",
      "acrobatic charge (ex)": "At 6th level, a cloud anchorite gains the ability to charge in situations where others cannot. She may charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement. This enables her to run down steep rock faces, leap down from an outcropping, or tumble over small boulders to get to the target of her charge. Depending on the circumstances, she may still need to make appropriate checks (Jump or Tumble checks in particular) to successfully move over the terrain.",
      "walk on the clouds (su)": "At 9th level, a cloud anchorite can use her empty stride ability as a free action at all times. Additionally, once per day she may use <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/air-walk--2772/\"><em>air walk</em></a> as a quickened spell-like ability. This effect manifests at a caster level equal to her cloud anchorite level.",
      "immortality of the mountain (su)": "Upon reaching 10th level, a cloud anchorite has achieved the apotheosis she has sought. She no longer has a maximum age, and will never die of old age. Additionally, she no longer has to make saving throws to avoid altitude sickness or fatigue from thin air, and gains a +2 sacred bonus on all Wisdom checks and all saving throws while in mountain terrain."

While operating in any area where bounty hunting is acceptable, a slavers guild has any presence, or you enjoy the patronage of an influential figure, you gain the benefit of the <a href=\"/feats/cityscape--53/special-dispensation--2685/\">Special Dispensation</a> feat (see page 63), even if you do not meet the prerequisites.",

This ability does not function if the opponent has a weapon of any sort in either hand, or if your attack deals lethal damage. Unarmed foes with the Improved Unarmed Strike feat are still considered unarmed. This ability never applies to ranged attacks, regardless of the target&#39;s proximity to you. If you score a critical hit with the melee attack, the extra damage from this ability is not multiplied. This extra damage increases to 2d6 points at 6th level, and to 3d6 at 9th level. Creatures not subject to nonlethal damage, as well as constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures, are not affected by this ability.",

      "threaten (ex)": "Crimson scourges of at least 7th level are masters at shaking the confidence of their foes. This ability grants three advantages when you use the Intimidate skill to demoralize an opponent (PH 76). First, you can attempt to demoralize an opponent as a move action, rather than a standard action. Second, a successful attempt causes the target to be shaken for a number of rounds equal to your unmodified Strength modifier (minimum 1 round). Finally, you gain a +2 bonus on any Intimidate check to demoralize an opponent.",
      "deadened hide (ex)": "Upon reaching 8th level, you become immune to nonlethal damage and to spells or effects that inflict or manipulate pain (DM&#39;s discretion). ",
      "smell of blood (ex)": "At the apex of your advancement, you acquire an almost animalistic awareness of the world around you. You gain the scent ability (MM 314) and a +3 insight bonus on initiative checks."

A daggerspell mage can cast a spell with somatic and material components even when holding a dagger in each hand. If a daggerspell mage holds anything other than a dagger, he must have at least one hand free to cast a spell with somatic or material components. Casting a spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally. In addition, a daggerspell mage can deliver a touch spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).",
      "invocation of the knife (su)": "Beginning at 2nd level, daggerspell mages develop a strong mystical connection between their arcane spellcasting abilities and the daggers that they wield. Whenever a daggerspell mage casts an arcane spell that deals energy damage, he can turn half of the damage dealt by the spell into magic slashing damage rather than energy damage. Energy resistance does not apply to this damage, but damage reduction might. This power does not affect a creature&#39;s ability to resist the affected spell with a saving throw or spell resistance. Using this ability does not require an action; its use is part of the action required to cast the affected spell. Only spells with a duration of instantaneous can be modified by this ability.",
      "spells per day/spells known": "Beginning at 2nd level, a daggerspell mage gains new spells per day at each level (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If he had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a daggerspell mage, he must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "Beginning at 3rd level, a daggerspell mage deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points at 9th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>. If a daggerspell mage gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.",
      "double daggercast (ex)": "As a daggerspell mage advances in level, the connection between his spellcasting abilities and his two-dagger fighting style strengthens. At 5th level and higher, a mage can hold the charge for one touch spell for each dagger that he is holding in his hands. He must designate which dagger holds each touch spell at the time the spell is cast. If one of these daggers leaves the daggerspell mage&#39;s hands, the spell immediately discharges harmlessly (unless the dagger is thrown by a mage with the arcane throw ability; see below).",
      "arcane infusion (su)": "At 7th level and higher, a daggerspell mage can infuse arcane spell power into his daggers, temporarily enabling them to deal extra energy damage. To use this ability, a mage must lose a prepared arcane spell from memory (or give up a potential spell slot for the day if he casts spells as a sorcerer). The daggerspell mage chooses one dagger that he is holding and an energy type (fire, cold, or electricity) when this ability is activated. The chosen dagger deals an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell level sacrificed. Multiple uses of this ability on the same dagger don&#39;t stack, even if different energy types are chosen. If the dagger is thrown, the energy damage applies to that attack, but then the effect immediately dissipates. Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137).",
      "arcane throw (ex)": "At 8th level and higher, a daggerspell mage can imbue arcane spell power into his thrown daggers. The mage can deliver a touch spell with a thrown dagger just as if he were making a melee attack. If the dagger hits, the touch spell is discharged against the creature or object struck. If the dagger misses its intended target, the dagger returns to the mage just before his next turn (as if it had the returning special ability; see page 225 of the <em>Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide</em>) and retains the spell just as if the mage had missed with a melee attack.",
      "daggerspell flurry (ex)": "A 10th-level daggerspell mage can blend spellcasting with a flurry of dagger attacks. When using this ability, a daggerspell mage can quicken one spell as part of a full attack with his daggers. Doing this has no effect on the spell&#39;s effective level. A daggerspell mage must make at least one melee attack in any round in which he uses this ability, and he cannot make an attack with anything other than a dagger (although if a spell cast in conjunction with this ability requires an attack roll, he can still make the spell&#39;s attack). A daggerspell mage can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Dexterity modifier (minimum 1)."

      "weapon and armor proficiency": "Daggerspell shapers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.",
      "daggercast (ex)": "Daggerspell shapers seamlessly blend the use of their twin daggers with powerful spellcasting abilities. A daggerspell shaper can cast a spell with somatic and material components even when holding a dagger in each hand. If a daggerspell shaper holds anything other than a dagger, she must have at least one hand free to cast a spell with somatic or material components. Casting a spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally.",
      "wild shape (su)": "A daggerspell shaper can change into a Small or Medium animal and back again, and can do so more often than most other characters with the wild shape ability. See the druid class feature, page 37 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>. This ability lasts for 1 hour per class level or until she changes back. Levels of the daggerspell shaper prestige class stack with druid levels for the purpose of determining the maximum duration of the wild shape ability; they do not stack for any other purpose (such as the size and type of creature that a shaper can become). ",
      "dagger claws (su)": "When a daggerspell shaper of 2nd level or higher uses wild shape, she adds any magical properties of daggers that she is holding in each hand into the natural attacks of her new form. The magic of a single dagger affects only the natural attacks made with the corresponding limb in the shaper&#39;s animal form, not all her attacks. For example, a 2nd-level daggerspell shaper holding a +1 <em>flaming dagger</em> in one hand and a +2 <em>keen dagger</em> in the other hand transforms into a leopard. The daggers affect the claw attacks of her new form as follows: One gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls and also gains the flaming special ability, and the other gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls and also gains the keen special ability. If the assumed form does not have a claw or slam attack with a limb that corresponds to the druid&#39;s natural limbs, this ability has no effect. The bonuses from this ability last for the duration of the wild shape effect. When a shaper uses this ability, her natural weapons in animal form overcome damage reduction exactly as do the daggers that she was holding when she transformed. In the example above, the shaper would be able to overcome a foe&#39;s damage reduction as if both of her natural weapons were magic.",
      "spells per day/spells known": "Beginning at 2nd level, a daggerspell shaper gains new spells per day at each level (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If she had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a daggerspell shaper, she must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "Beginning at 3rd level, a daggerspell shaper deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points at 9th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>. If a daggerspell shaper gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.",
      "fast wild shape (ex)": "Starting at 7th level, a daggerspell shaper can use her wild shape ability as a move action rather than as a standard action.",
      "enhanced wild shape (su)": "Starting at 8th level, a daggerspell shaper can preserve the physical enhancements granted by her equipment even when in wild shape. Whenever the shaper uses wild shape, she retains any enhancement bonuses to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution granted by any equipment she wears, even if the equipment can&#39;t be worn normally by her new form.",
      "daggerspell flurry (ex)": "A 10th-level daggerspell shaper can blend spellcasting with a flurry of dagger attacks. When using this ability, the shaper can quicken one spell as part of a full attack with her daggers. Doing this has no effect on the spell&#39;s effective level. A daggerspell shaper must make at least one melee attack in any round in which she uses this ability, and she cannot make an attack with anything other than a dagger (although if a spell cast in conjunction with this ability requires an attack roll, she can still make the spell&#39;s attack).

      "defensive awareness (ex)": "Starting at 2nd level, the Daidoji bodyguard gains the extraordinary ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to even be aware of it. At 2nd level and higher, he retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)",
      "evasion (ex)": "At 3rd level and higher, a Daidoji bodyguard can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If the bodyguard makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. The Daidoji bodyguard can only use evasion if he is wearing light armor or no armor.",
      "moving the shadow (ex)": "At 4th level, a Daidoji bodyguard learns the techniques of taking advantage of an opponent&#39;s armor. The Daidoji bodyguard gains a dodge bonus to his AC equal to the armor check penalty (if any) of the opponent striking him.",

Subtract 3 from the damage the Daidoji bodyguard takes each time he is dealt damage. At 9th level, this damage reduction rises to 6. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. (That is, the bodyguard cannot actually gain hit points in this manner.)",
      "defensive roll (ex)": "At 8th level, the Daidoji bodyguard learns to roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it. Once per day, when a Daidoji bodyguard would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the bodyguard can attempt to roll with the damage. He makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if successful, takes only half damage from the blow. He must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute his defensive roll&#8212;if he is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, he can&#39;t roll. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the bodyguard&#39;s evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll."

This bonus also applies on Search checks made to detect stonework traps.",
      "enhanced darkvision (ex)": "Dark hunters spend most of their lives in the darkest caverns they can find. As a dark hunter&#39;s skills improve, her almost mystical understanding of the deep caverns sharpens her inborn visual acuity. If a dark hunter does not already have darkvision when she attains 2nd level, she gains it at a range of 30 feet. If she already had darkvision, she adds 30 feet to the range. Once a dark hunter attains 4th level, her darkvision range increases by an extra 30 feet. ",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "If a dark hunter can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the dark hunter&#39;s target would be denied his Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the dark hunter&#39;s attack deals an extra 1d6 points of damage.

As long as the dark hunter is within 5 feet of the wall, she gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks and can successfully hide herself from view in the open without having anything to actually hide behind.",
      "death attack (ex)": "If a dark hunter studies her victim for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (dark hunter&#39;s choice). While studying the target, the dark hunter can undertake other actions as long as her attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the dark hunter or recognize the dark hunter as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the dark hunter&#39;s class level + the dark hunter&#39;s Int modifier) against the kill effect, he dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim&#39;s mind and body become enervated, rendering him helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the dark hunter. If the victim&#39;s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the dark hunter has completed the 3 rounds of study, she must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes his save) or if the dark hunter does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before she can attempt another death attack."

If you study a single underground location for at least 8 hours, that location becomes your directional focus until you choose a new location and study it for 8 hours. You must be within your directional focus to successfully study it. You can use find the path (as the spell) to determine the shortest, most direct physical route to your directional focus, as long as you are within 5 miles of your focus. This ability works only as long as you remain underground.",
      "spelunking (ex)": "You are well trained in moving in and through natural caverns. You gain a competence bonus equal to your class level on Climb, Escape Artist, Jump, Survival, and Swim checks as long as you remain underground. In addition, you are treated as one size category smaller than your actual size for the purpose of squeezing into narrow tunnels or confi ned areas.",
      "darkrunner emblem": "Upon becoming a darkrunner, you are granted a darkrunner emblem by the Darkrunner Guild. This minor magic item is detailed in the accompanying sidebar. If your emblem is lost or destroyed, you can purchase a replacement from any guild chapter house at a 50% discount.",
      "aberration lore (ex)": "You have picked up a trove of knowledge concerning aberrations. Beginning at 2nd level, you gain a +2 competence bonus on any skill check, attack roll, or saving throw made against an aberration.",
      "darkvision (ex)": "Starting at 2nd level, the extent of your darkvision increases by 10 feet. It increases by an additional 10 feet every other level.",
      "cavefighting (ex)": "Beginning at 3rd level, you are so familiar with the terrain features of the subterranean world that you can use them to enhance your combat ability. While underground, you gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your Intelligence bonus, and you can move over difficult terrain (see page 148 of the Player&#39;s Handbook) at normal speed. Additionally, as long as you stand in a square of diffi cult terrain, such as rubble or thick undergrowth, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Armor Class.",
      "tunnelport (sp)": "At 3rd level and higher, you can use an enlarged dimension door effect as a spell-like ability once per day. You cannot pass through solid barriers as you normally could with a dimension door spell. Additionally, the route you take when using tunnelport must follow an opening no more than 10 feet wide. Your caster level equals twice your darkrunner class level.",
      "tremorsense (ex)": "Beginning at 4th level, you have tremorsense out to 30 feet. You are sensitive to vibrations in the ground and can automatically pinpoint the location of anything that is in contact with the ground.",
      "lore of the stones (sp)": "At 5th level, you gain an affinity with unworked stone. You treat unworked stone as very soft ground when making Survival checks to track quarry, and can use stone tell as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to your class level) once per day.",
      "aberration specialist (ex)": "At 6th level, your knowledge about a particular kind of underground-dwelling aberration increases. You must select a specific kind of aberration that has an environment entry of Underground, such as gibbering mouther, mind flayer, or umber hulk. Against this kind of aberration, your bonuses from your aberration lore ability increase to +4.",
      "deepsong (su)": "All that occurs in the depths of the earth is witnessed by the stone. Over the ages, an infinite legion of events have occurred, and in their passing they have left their mark upon the stone. Beginning at 7th level, you can attune your mind to experience the deepsong. The deepsong can be seen, felt, heard, and tasted, and it even makes itself known in mystical ways. While underground, the deepsong fills you with a sense of belonging and welcome. This effect grants you a +2 morale bonus on all Will saving throws. In addition, your stone tell spell-like ability becomes much more powerful than the normal spell. When you use this ability, the stones relate complete descriptions of events when asked. You can gain knowledge of up to three facts from among the following topics with each use: the layout of caverns and tunnels; the presence of plants and fungi, minerals, bodies of water, or people; local animal population; and the presence of elemental creatures, powerful abominations, or undead.",
      "improved cavefighting (ex)": "At 8th level, your cavefighting techniques improve further. You can take 10 at any time with any of the following skills while underground, even if you are threatened or distracted: Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Jump, and Swim. <br />In addition, you master a style of fighting that incorporates the terrain into your attacks. You might cause an opponent to slip with a successful attack and twist an ankle on loose rocks or to stagger into a sharp stalactite. You might brace yourself against a cave wall to get a little bit of extra pull on your bow. In any case, this fighting style works only if you are standing in a square of difficult terrain. As long as you do so, you add a circumstance bonus equal to your Intelligence bonus (minimum +1) to damage rolls with all melee weapons and any ranged weapon attacks at a range of 30 feet or less.",
      "greater tunnelport (sp)": "Beginning at 9th level, your tunnelport ability functions like greater teleport, although you are still bound by the restrictions on the width of passages you can teleport though. Your caster level equals twice your darkrunner class level.",
      "stonewalking (su)": "At 10th level, you no longer need confine your underground exploration to caverns and passageways. For a limited number of rounds per day, you can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. While stonewalking, you have a burrow speed equal to your base land speed; this burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of a presence. A move earth spell cast on an area where you are stonewalking flings you back 30 feet and stuns you for 1 round if you fail a DC 15 Fortitude save. <br />You can stonewalk for a number of rounds each day equal to 10 + your Intelligence modifier. These rounds need not be continuous; you can activate this ability for 4 rounds to pass through a collapsed tunnel and still have the remainder of your rounds available for use later in the same day. Activating and deactivating stonewalking is a free action. If you are still burrowing when you run out of time, you are immediately ejected into the nearest open surface large enough to contain you. Distance is not a factor, but the ejection is quite painful and forces you to make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per 5 feet traveled to reach the open area) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds."

A darkwood stalker also gets the bonus on damage with ranged weapons, but only against targets within 30 feet (the darkwood stalker cannot strike with deadly accuracy beyond that range). The bonus on damage does not apply against creatures that are im mune to critical hits. At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, the darkwood stalker&#39;s bonus goes up by +2.",
      "uncanny dodge (ex)": "Starting at 2nd level, a darkwood stalker gains the ability to react to danger before his senses would normally allow him to do so. He retains his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. He still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. ",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "If a darkwood stalker can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for an extra 1d6 points of damage. For complete details on the sneak attack ability, see the description of the dark hunter earlier in this chapter.",
      "darkvision (ex)": "Although stealthy and keen-eyed, the darkwood stalker is often at a disadvantage against orcs when fighting in the darkness. Long ago, elven sages developed a ritual to allow the most dedicated stalkers to overcome this disadvantage. Now, as they grow in experience, their night vision continually improves, eventually matching the darkvision of their hated foes. At 4th level, a darkwood stalker gains darkvision out to 30 feet, and at 7th level, the range increases to 60 feet. If the darkwood stalker already has darkvision as a racial ability, this ability does not increase it. ",
      "improved uncanny dodge (ex)": "At 5th level and higher, a darkwood stalker can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies other characters the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack him. The exception to this defense is that a rogue of at least four levels higher than the character can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). If a darkwood stalker gains the uncanny dodge ability from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.",
      "dodge critical (ex)": "Although often more skilled than their orc foes, darkwood stalkers have seen too many battles won by one lucky blow from a falchion. At 8th level, a darkwood stalker becomes able to turn even the luckiest blow into a grazing strike. Once per day, a darkwood stalker can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + the enhancement bonus, if any, possessed by the weapon) to turn a critical hit dealt upon him into a normal hit. The darkwood stalker must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed, and he must declare his attempt to reduce the effect of the critical hit before the damage from the hit is rolled.",
      "death attack (ex)": "If a 10th-level darkwood stalker studies a particular orc for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. While studying the orc, the darkwood hunter can undertake other actions as long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the darkwood stalker or recognize the darkwood stalker as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the darkwood stalker&#39;s class level + the darkwood stalker&#39;s Wis modifier), he dies. If the victim&#39;s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the darkwood stalker has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes his save) or if the darkwood stalker does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before he can attempt another death attack."

The demonologist&#39;s spell list appears below; a demonologist has access to any spell on the list and need not prepare those spells ahead of time, just like a sorcerer. A demonologist casts spells just as a sorcerer does.",
      "charm demon (sp)": "A 1st-level demonologist can attempt to charm a chaotic evil outsider, as described in the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/charm-person--2535/\"><em>charm person</em></a> spell, once per day. The demon does not get to use its spell resistance, though it can make a saving throw as normal (DC 11 + demonologist&#39;s Cha modifier).",
      "quasit familiar (ex)": "A 2nd-level demonologist gains a quasit as a familiar, whether he wants it or not. If the demonologist already has a familiar, the quasit devours it and takes its place, but the character suffers no experience point loss. The quasit is treated as a normal familiar, using the class level of the demonologist as the master&#39;s level (see the Familiars section in Chapter 3 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em> for familiar abilities).",
      "summoning mastery (su)": "When a demonologist of 3rd level or higher casts a <em>summon monster</em> spell, it is treated as the equivalent spell of two levels higher for purposes of summoning chaotic evil creatures. For example, a demonologist refers to the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/summon-monster-iv--2444/\"><em>summon monster IV</em></a> list for chaotic evil outsiders when casting <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/summon-monster-ii--2442/\"><em>summon monster II</em></a>. At 6th level, the demonologist refers to the summoning list three levels higher than the one for the summon monster spell he is casting. At 9th level, the demonologist refers to the list four levels higher. ",
      "resistances (su)": "A demonologist who reaches 4th level gains acid resistance 10, cold resistance 10, fire resist- ance 10, and electricity resistance 20.",
      "poison immunity (ex)": "A 5th-level demonologist is immune to poison.",
      "hold demon (sp)": "A 7th-level demonologist can attempt to hold a chaotic evil outsider, as described in the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/hold-person--2558/\"><em>hold person</em></a> spell, once per day. The demon does not get to use its spell resistance, though it can make a saving throw as normal (DC 12 + demonologist&#39;s Cha modifier). ",

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points beyond those received from the prestige class, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that he adds the new level of diabolist to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. For example, if Lady Mandrake, a 9th-level sorcerer, gains a level in diabolist, he gains new spells as if he had risen to 10th level in sorcerer, but uses the other diabolist aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonus. If he next gains a level of sorcerer, making him a 10th-level sorcerer/1st-level diabolist, he gains spells as if he had risen to 11th level as a sorcerer.",

Any spell the diabolist casts that affects a target or area (one that does not include herself) gains the evil descriptor and deals +1d6 points of unholy damage to any good character affected by the spell. For example, a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\"><em>fireball</em></a> cast by a 6th-level wizard/1st-level diabolist deals 7d6 points of fire damage and 1d6 points of unholy damage. a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/hold-person--2558/\"><em>hold person</em></a> spell cast by the same diabolist holds a humanoid target motionless and deals 1d6 points of unholy damage if the target is good. At 5th level, the unholy damage increases to +2d6 points. At 10th level, the unholy damage increases to +3d6 points.",
      "imp familiar (ex)": "A 2nd-level diabolist gains an imp as a familiar, whether she wants it or not. If the diabolist already has a familiar, the imp devours it and takes its place. The imp is treated as a normal familiar, using the class level of the diabolist as the wizard&#39;s level (See the Familiars section in Chapter 3 of <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em> for familiar abilities).",
      "vile diabolism (ex)": "An 8th-level diabolist can use her diabolism power to deal half the normal amount of extra unholy damage as vile damage (see Chapter 2 for an explanation of vile damage). For example, a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\"><em>fireball</em></a> cast by a 6th-level wizard/8th-level diabolist deals 10d6 points of fire damage and 2d6 points of unholy damage. If the diabolist then rolls a 7 for the 2d6 points of unholy damage, she can (if she chooses) convert the unholy damage into 3 points of vile damage instead."

A dragon rider counts a dragon&#39;s Effective Character Level as being 3 lower than its actual value.

The bonus feat does not count against the dragon&#39;s normal feat capacity, though it must still meet all prerequisites, as noted in the appropriate feat descriptions.

      "weapon and armor proficiency": "Dragonfire adepts are proficient with simple weapons, but not with armor or shields. Like arcane spellcasters, a dragonfire adept wearing armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (all invocations have somatic components). ",
      "invocations": "A dragonfire adept has a repertoire of attacks, defenses, and other abilities known as draconic invocations, which allow her to focus the draconic energy that suffuses her soul. A dragonfire adept can use any invocation she knows at will. ",
      "breath weapon (su)": "At 1st level, you gain a breath weapon that you can use at will as a standard action. Each time you use your breath weapon, you can choose whether it takes the form of a 15-foot cone or a 30-foot line. This breath weapon deals 1d6 points of fire damage; a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your class level + your Con modifier) halves the damage. As you gain levels, your breath weapon&#39;s damage increases, as shown on Table 2&#8212;1.",

These breath effects can alter your breath weapon&#39;s damage type or area, or apply a condition to targets in place of damage. Each time you use your breath weapon, you can choose to apply any one breath effect that you know. The chosen effect either replaces the normal fire damage dealt by your breath weapon or replaces the standard area of your breath weapon. Some effects can be applied only to a cone-shaped breath weapon, and others only to a line-shaped breath weapon. You can&#39;t apply more than one breath effect to your breath weapon unless the effect specifically states otherwise. Also, you can&#39;t apply the same breath effect to your breath weapon in two consecutive rounds (though you still can use your normal fire breath weapon every round).",
      "scales (ex)": "At 2nd level, your skin becomes thick and scaly, granting you a +2 bonus to your natural armor. The scales can be of any color or metallic hue; they are often (but not always) of a draconic hue that matches your outlook and alignment. This bonus improves to +3 at 8th level, to +4 at 13th level, and to +5 at 18th level.",
      "dragonkin (ex)": "At 4th level, you gain a +4 competence bonus on Diplomacy checks made to influence the attitude of dragons or creatures of the dragonblood subtype (see page 4). You are treated as a dragon for the purpose of determining whether frightful presence can affect you.",
      "damage reduction (ex)": "At 6th level, you gain damage reduction 2/magic. At 16th level, this improves to damage reduction 5/magic.",
      "immunities (ex)": "At 19th level, you gain immunity to paralysis and sleep."

You can&#39;t use sudden strike to deliver nonlethal damage. Weapons capable of dealing only nonlethal damage don&#39;t deal extra damage when used as part of a sudden strike. Otherwise, this ability functions as the sneak attack rogue class feature (PH 50), and it stacks with sneak attack whenever both would apply to the same target.

Undead creatures within this burst are healed the same amount of hit points as the damage she deals to living creatures.

Once a new spell is selected, it is added to that dread necromancer&#39;s spell list and can be cast just like any other spell she knows. If a spell is both a cleric spell and a wizard spell, use the lower of the two spell levels (when different) to determine what level the spell is for a dread necromancer.

      "scabrous touch (su)": "Starting at 6th level, once per day a dread necromancer can use her charnel touch to inflict disease on a creature she touches. This ability works like the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/contagion--2721/\"><em>contagion</em></a> spell (see page 213 of the Player&#39;s Handbook), inflicting the disease of her choice immediately, with no incubation period, unless the target makes a successful Fortitude save (DC10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier). The DC for subsequent saving throws to resist the effects of the disease depends on the disease inflicted; see page 292 of the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide for details. ",
      "summon familiar": "At 7th level or anytime thereafter, a dread necromancer can obtain a familiar. The familiar she acquires is more powerful than a standard wizard&#39;s or sorcerer&#39;s familiar, but it is unequivocally evil. The player of a dread necromancer character chooses one of the following creatures: imp (devil), quasit (demon), vargouille, or ghostly visage. All these creatures are described in the Monster Manual except for the ghostly visage, an undead symbiont described on page 221 of the Fiend Folio.",
      "undead mastery": "All undead creatures created by a dread necromancer who has reached 8th level or higher gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and 2 additional hit points per Hit Die.",
      "negative energy resistance": "Beginning at 9th level, a dread necromancer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist negative energy effects, including energy drain, some ability drain, and <em>inflict</em> spells.",
      "light fortification": "Starting at 10th level, a dread necromancer gains 25% resistance to critical hits; this is the equivalent of the light fortification armor special ability described on page 219 of the Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide. At 17th level, this fortification increases to 50%. ",
      "enervating touch (su)": "When a dread necromancer reaches 12th level, she gains the ability to bestow negative levels when she uses her charnel touch attack. Each day, she can bestow a total number of negative levels equal to one-half her class level, but no more than two negative levels with a single touch. The saving throw to remove the negative levels has a DC of 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Charisma modifier.",
      "craft wondrous item": "At 19th level, the dread necromancer gains <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/craft-wondrous-item--483/\">Craft Wondrous Item</a> as a bonus feat. This helps her prepare the phylactery required to become a lich. ",
      "lich transformation": "When a dread necromancer attains 20th level, she undergoes a hideous transformation and becomes a lich. Her type changes to undead, and she gains all the traits of the undead (see page 317 of the Monster Manual). She no longer has a Constitution score, all her existing Hit Dice become d12s, and she must reroll her hit points. A dread necromancer need not pay experience points or gold to create her phylactery."

      "weapon and armor proficiency": "Dread pirates are proficient with all simple weapons, with light martial weapons, and with the rapier. Dread pirates are proficient with light armor but not with shields.",
      "seamanship (ex)": "A dread pirate adds his class level as an insight bonus on all Profession (sailor) checks. Allies within sight or hearing of a dread pirate add an insight bonus equal to half this number on their Profession (sailor) checks.",
      "two-weapon fighting": "A dread pirate wearing light or no armor is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the prerequisites for the feat.",
      "fearsome reputation (ex)": "By the time he attains 2nd level, a dread pirate has developed a reputation on the high seas. At this point, he must choose whether to cultivate a reputation as an honorable pirate (avoiding undue bloodshed, honoring flags of truce, and the like) or as a dishonorable pirate (favoring mayhem and dire treatment of prisoners).",
      "rally the crew (ex)": "Starting at 3rd level, an honorable dread pirate can inspire his allies (including himself) to great bravery in combat once per day. This inspiration grants them a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. To be affected, an ally must be able to see or hear the dread pirate. The effect requires a free action to activate and lasts for 1 minute per class level, even if the dread pirate moves out of range or loses consciousness. This is a mind-affecting ability. ",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "Beginning at 3rd level, a dishonorable dread pirate deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>. The amount of extra damage dealt increases to 2d6 at 7th level. If a dishonorable dread pirate gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.",
      "acrobatic charge (ex)": "A dread pirate of 4th level or higher can charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement or through the squares occupied by allies blocking his path. This ability enables him to charge across a cluttered ship&#39;s deck, leap down from a higher deck, or swing between two adjacent ships to get to his target. Depending on the circumstances, he might still need to make appropriate checks (such as Jump, Tumble, or Use Rope checks) to successfully move over the terrain.",
      "steady stance (ex)": "At 4th level and higher, a dread pirate remains stable on his feet when others have difficulty standing. He is not considered flat-footed while balancing or climbing, and he adds his class level as a bonus on Balance or Climb checks to remain balancing or climbing when he takes damage.",
      "luck of the wind (ex)": "Once per day, an honorable dread pirate of 5th level or higher can reroll any failed attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw. He must take the result of the reroll, even if it&#39;s worse than the original roll.",
      "scourge of the seas (ex)": "Starting at 5th level, a dishonorable dread pirate can instill fear into his enemies. When the character uses Intimidate to demoralize foes, the attempt affects all enemies within 30 feet who can see and hear him, and the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Multiple uses of this ability don&#39;t stack. This is a mind-affecting ability.",
      "skill mastery (ex)": "At 8th level, a dread pirate becomes supremely confident of his mobility. He has mastered the skills Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble to the extent that he can take 10 with them even under stress.",
      "fight to the death (ex)": "At 9th level and higher, an honorable dread pirate can inspire his allies to carry on against tremendous odds. Each ally affected by the dread pirate&#39;s rally the crew ability (see above) also gains temporary hit points equal to 10 + the dread pirate&#39;s Cha bonus (minimum 10), gains a dodge bonus to Armor Class equal to the dread pirate&#39;s Cha bonus (minimum +1), and is treated as having the Diehard feat even if he doesn&#39;t meet the prerequisites. These effects are lost if the dread pirate loses consciousness.",
      "motivate the scum (ex)": "Once per day, a dishonorable dread pirate of 9th level or higher can motivate his allies by killing a helpless individual. All allies of the dread pirate who see the act gain a +2 morale bonus on damage rolls. This effect lasts for 24 hours.",
      "pirate king (ex)": "A 10th-level dread pirate&#39;s exploits have become so legendary that great numbers of able sailors are willing to sign on as his crew for no compensation other than a share of the booty. Treat this ability as the equivalent of the Leadership feat, except that only followers (and no cohorts) are gained."

      "weapon and armor proficiency": "Drunken masters gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.",
      "drink like a demon (ex)": "A drunken master&#39;s body handles alcohol differently from other people&#39;s. He can drink a large tankard of ale, a bottle of wine, or a corresponding amount of stronger alcohol as a move action. Every bottle or tankard of alcohol he consumes during combat reduces his Wisdom and Intelligence by 2 points each, but increases his Strength or Constitution (character&#39;s choice) by 2 points. A drunken master may benefit from a number of drinks equal to his class level. The duration of both the penalty and the bonus is a number of rounds equal to the character&#39;s drunken master level + 3.",
      "improvised weapons (ex)": "While bottles and tankards are a drunken master&#39;s preferred improvised weapons, he can use furniture, farm implements, or nearly anything else at hand to attack his foes. A drunken master&#39;s improvised weapon deals as much damage as his unarmed strike plus an extra 1d4 points. Most improvised weapons deal bludgeoning damage, although some (a broken glass bottle, for example) would deal piercing or slashing damage. When a drunken master rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll while using an improvised weapon, that weapon breaks apart and becomes useless.",
      "stagger (ex)": "By tripping, stumbling, and staggering, a drunken master of 2nd level or higher can make a charge attack that surprises his opponents. This ability has two beneficial aspects: First, the charge need not be in a straight line, even though the character can still move up to twice his speed. Second, if a drunken master makes a DC 15 Tumble check before beginning a charge, his movement through threatened squares provokes no attacks of opportunity.",
      "swaying waist (ex)": "At 3rd level, a drunken master knows how to weave and bob during an attack, making him more difficult to hit. The character gains a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against any one opponent he chooses during his turn.",
      "ac bonus (ex)": "At 4th level, a drunken master gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class. This bonus improves to +2 at 9th level.",
      "improved improvised weapons (ex)": "A drunken master of 4th level or higher can use long improvised weapons (such as ladders) as reach weapons according to their length, and improvised weapons with many protrusions (such as chairs) provide a +2 bonus on opponents&#39; disarm attempts. Finally, large objects with broad, flat surfaces (such as tables) can be upended to become improvised tower shields.",
      "greater improvised weapons (ex)": "At 5th level and higher, a drunken master wielding an improvised weapon deals an extra 1d8 points of damage instead of 1d4. Improved Feint (Ex): A drunken master who attains 6th level gains Improved Feint as a bonus feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites.",
      "improved grapple (ex)": "A drunken master who attains 7th level gains Improved Grapple as a bonus feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites.",
      "for medicinal purposes (sp)": "At 8th level, a drunken master gains the ability to convert a single alcoholic drink he has ingested into a single potion of cure moderate wounds, as if he had just drunk a dose of the potion. To use this ability, the character must be under the effect of an alcoholic drink (see Drink Like a Demon, above). When he converts one drink of alcohol into one dose of the potion, his ability scores change (+2 to Intelligence and Wisdom, &#8212;2 to Strength or Constitution) as if the duration of the alcohol&#39;s effect had expired. This ability can be used up to three times per day. It is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.",
      "corkscrew rush (ex)": "A drunken master of 9th level or higher can perform this maneuver, leaping forward and twisting his body in midair as he attempts to head-butt an opponent. When making a charge attack he can, in addition to dealing normal damage, initiate a bull rush (without provoking an attack of opportunity). If the bull rush attempt succeeds, the opponent is stunned unless she makes a Will save (DC 10 + the drunken master&#39;s class level + the drunken master&#39;s Wis modifier). However, if the bull rush attempt fails, the drunken master lands prone in front of the opponent.",
      "superior improvised weapons (ex)": "At 9th level and higher, a drunken master wielding an improvised weapon deals an extra 1d12 points of damage instead of 1d8. Breath of Flame (Sp): A 10th-level drunken master can ignite some of the alcohol within his body and spew it forth from his mouth as a free action. This breath of flame deals 3d12 points of fire damage to all within the 20-foot cone, or half damage to those who make a Reflex save (DC 10 + the drunken master&#39;s class level + the drunken master&#39;s Con modifier). Each time a drunken master uses breath of flame, it consumes one drink&#39;s worth of alcohol from within his body, lessening the penalty to his Wisdom and Intelligence scores and reducing the bonus to his Strength or Constitution score (character&#39;s choice)."

      "trap sense (ex)": "A dungeon delver is adept at evading the effects of traps. See the barbarian class feature, page 26 of the Player&#39;s Handbook. The bonuses rise by 1 for every three additional dungeon delver levels gained (+2 at 4th level, +3 at 7th level, and +4 at 10th level) and stack with similar bonuses granted by other classes.",

Starting at 2nd level, a dungeon delver can use reduce person on himself three times per day (regardless of his creature type). His caster level is equal to his class level.",

This functions exactly as the dwarf racial trait of the same name (see page 15 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>), except that the check modifiers are competence bonuses rather than racial bonuses.

Once per day, he can use augury as a free action; his caster level is equal to his class level. He can use this ability one additional time per day for every three additional class levels gained (2/day at 6th level and 3/day at 9th level). ",
      "skill mastery (ex)": "At 3rd level, a dungeon delver becomes so confident in the use of certain skills that he can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. The character selects a number of skills equal to 3 + his Intelligence modifier. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>.",

      "blindsense (ex)": "At 5th level, a dungeon delver gains the ability to activate an acute sensitivity to sounds, smells, movement, and other disturbances within 30 feet. This functions as described on page 306 of the <em>Monster Manual</em> and lasts for 1 minute per class level. A dungeon delver can use blindsense once per day at 5th level and twice per day at 10th level.",
      "passwall (sp)": "Starting at 6th level, a dungeon delver can use <em>passwall</em> once per day as a caster of his class level. This ability comes in handy for bypassing small cave-ins or sneaking into vaults.",
      "find the path (sp)": "Starting at 8th level, a dungeon delver can use <em>find the path</em> twice per day as a caster of his class level. Typically, a delver uses this to find his way into and out of confounding mazes and dungeons. He can target only himself with the ability.",
      "phase door (sp)": "At 9th level, a dungeon delver gains the ability to use <em>phase door</em> once per day as an 18th-level caster. This ability enables him to bypass cave-ins, walk through dead ends and immovable obstructions, and make quick escapes through walls."

If you are proficient with light armor, you can cast infiltrator spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal chance for arcane spell failure. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, an infiltrator wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs the normal chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass infiltrator still incurs the normal chance for arcane spell failure when casting arcane spells received from other classes.",
      "spells": "Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast an infiltrator spell, you must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell&#39;s level, so if you have an Intelligence of 10 or lower, you cannot cast these spells. Bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + your Intelligence modifier. When you get 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance 1st-level spells for 1st level), you gain only the bonus spells to which you would be entitled based on your Intelligence score for that spell level. Your spell list appears below. You prepare and cast spells just as a wizard does.",

      "combat anticipation (ex)": "Beginning at 3rd level, your ability to effectively observe the world around you allows you to respond more swiftly to danger. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class, and a +1 bonus on both Reflex saves and initiative checks. These bonuses increase to +2 at 6th level. The bonuses to AC and Reflex saves come in part because you read the intentions of your foe. Thus, you gain those bonuses only against humanoids, monstrous humanoids, and giants. Other creatures are too anatomically different for you to easily anticipate their intentions. This ability functions only when you are wearing light or no armor.",
      "uncanny dodge (ex)": "At 4th level, you cannot be caught flat-footed and react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so. This ability functions like the barbarian ability of the same name (<span class=\"caps\">PHB</span> 26). If you already have uncanny dodge from some other source, you instead gain improved uncanny dodge at this level.",

      "shadow in the night (sp)": "When you reach 10th level, your mastery of stealth has crossed over into the otherworldly. Once per day, you can become ethereal. This effect lasts for up to 1 round, plus a number of additional rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. This ability otherwise functions as the spell <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/ethereal-jaunt--2809/\">ethereal jaunt</a>."

      "recall class features (ex)": "At 2nd level, an emancipated spawn remembers more of her former existence. She now can use all the class features of one former class, as a character of that former class&#39;s level. If the former class was a spellcasting class, the emancipated spawn is able to cast one spell of each level avail- able to the character (if she was a wizard, she must still consult her spellbook, or learn from scrolls if her spellbook was lost when she became a spawn). If the character had a familiar, the empathic link between her and the familiar is reestablished.",
      "rediscovery (ex)": "At 3rd level, the emancipated spawn comes fully into her heritage. She recalls all her former class features and abilities, regains her former base attack bonus, base saving throw bonuses gained from class levels, hit points, and all other class benefits, and can now advance again in any of her former classes. This applies even if a former character class does not normally allow free multiclassing, provided the character did not leave the path prior to her transformation into an undead spawn. Thus, a former paladin could continue to gain levels as a paladin (effectively multiclassing as a monster/paladin), but if she had left the path of paladinhood before her transformation, she is still ineligible to return to that class."

These bonus spells can be added to whatever levels of spells the eunuch warlock can currently cast, but no more than one can be added to the character&#39;s highest current spell level. Example: Wieh Wan is a 9th-level wu jen who takes one level in eunuch warlock.

Example: Wieh Wan is a 9th-level wu jen/4th-level eunuch warlock. When he reaches 5th level as a eunuch warlock, he gains the ability to cast 6th-level wu jen spells. He must allocate one of his bonus spells to 6th level in order to cast any 6th-level spells, unless his Intelligence is high enough (22 or higher) to give him a bonus 6th-level spell."

For example, a bard 3/evangelist 5 improves his inspire competence ability, but does not gain any new bard abilities. He could use bardic music to convert the unfaithful, countersong, fascinate, inspire the righteous, inspire courage +2, inspire dread or inspire hope, but would not gain the inspire competence, inspire greatness, or suggestion abilities. Alternately, a bard 7/evangelist 1 would be able to use bardic music to countersong, fascinate, inspire competence, inspire courage +2, inspire dread or inspire hope, and suggestion. Evangelist oratory abilities function in exactly the same manner as bardic music except the evangelist must speak loudly and clearly, rather than sing or play an instrument.",

When making a skill check with one of the selected skills, he may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent him from doing so."

This bonus increases by another +1 for every three eye of Gruumsh levels gained thereafter.",
      "blinding spittle (ex)": "An eye of Gruumsh of 4th level or higher can launch blinding spittle at any opponent within 20 feet. With a successful ranged touch attack (at a &#8212;4 penalty), he spits his stomach acid into the target&#39;s eyes. An opponent who fails a Reflex save (DC 10 + eye of Gruumsh&#39;s class level + eye of Gruumsh&#39;s Con modifier) is blinded until he or she can rinse away the spittle. This attack has no effect on creatures that don&#39;t have eyes or don&#39;t depend on vision. Blinding spittle is usable twice per day at 4th level and four times per day at 7th level.",
      "blindsight (ex)": "At 5th level, an eye of Gruumsh gains blindsight (see page 306 of the Monster Manual) out to 5 feet. The range increases to 10 feet at 8th level.",
      "sight of gruumsh (ex)": "At 10th level, an eye of Gruumsh gains the ability to see the moment of his own death through his missing eye. This foreknowledge gives him a +2 morale bonus on all saving throws and Armor Class from then on. He also does not go unconscious when reduced to negative hit points; however, the character still dies at &#8212;10 hit points. (Whether or not the vision is accurate is irrelevant&#8212;the character believes it to be true.)"

      "weapon and armor proficiency</strong>: fatemakers are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. fatemakers are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields).</p><p>because the somatic components required for fatemaker spells are relatively simple, a fatemaker can cast fatemaker spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. however, like any other arcane spellcaster, a fatemaker wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (as most do). a fatemaker still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.</p><p><strong>spells</strong>: beginning at 1st level, a fatemaker gains the ability to cast a number of arcane spells. to cast a spell, a fatemaker must have a charisma score of at least 10 + the spell&#39;s level, so a fatemaker with a charisma of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. fatemaker bonus spells are based on charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a dc of 10 + spell level + the fatemaker&#39;s cha modifi er. when table 3&#8212;3 indicates that a fatemaker gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level (for instance, 1st-level spells for a 1st-level fatemaker), she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her charisma score for that spell level. the fatemaker&#39;s spell list appears below. a fatemaker casts spells just as a sorcerer does.</p><p>upon reaching 6th level, and at every even-numbered level after that (8th and 10th), a fatemaker can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. the new spell&#39;s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level fatemaker spell the character can cast. a fatemaker can swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for that level.</p><table><tr><th style=\"text-align:center;\"

she adds 1 point to her charisma score at 1st, 5th, and 10th level.</p><p><strong>confidence of the fated (su)</strong>: once per day, a fatemaker of 2nd level or higher can add her class level as a morale bonus on any single attack roll, weapon damage roll, saving throw, or skill check. at 7th level and higher, she can do this twice per day, but only once in any given round.</p><p><strong>sneak attack (ex)</strong>: beginning at 3rd level, a fatemaker deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on any successful melee attack against a flat-footed or flanked target, or against a target that has been denied its dexterity bonus for any reason. this damage also applies to ranged attacks against targets up to 30 feet away. creatures with concealment, creatures without discernible anatomies, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are all immune to sneak attacks. a fatemaker can choose to deliver nonlethal damage with her sneak attack, but only when using a weapon designed for that purpose, such as a sap (blackjack).</p><p>at 6th level, the extra damage dealt by a fatemaker&#39;s sneak attack increases to 2d6 points, and at 9th level it increases to 3d6 points.</p><p><strong>aura of confidence (su)</strong>: a fatemaker&#39;s confidence tends to rub off on her allies. beginning at 4th level, a fatemaker grants a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks to all adjacent allies (but not to herself). this ability functions only while the fatemaker is conscious.</p><p>at 8th level, the bonus increases to +2.</p><p><strong>ego manifestation (sp)</strong>: at 10th level, a fatemaker&#39;s internal confidence and ego can be made physically manifest, increasing her size and power. this effect is the equivalent of the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/righteous-might--2865/\"><em>righteous might</em></a> spell (caster level equals class level), except that the fatemaker doesn&#39;t gain damage reduction, but

Your hands and feet become clawlike (destroying any shoes or gloves you are wearing), and your teeth lengthen and grow pointed. For the duration of the trance, you gain a +4 bonus to Dexterity and a +2 bonus on damage rolls with your unarmed strikes. You can also make one bite attack per round at your highest attack bonus whenever you attack as a full-round action.<br />The damage for this attack is 1d6 + your Str modifier, re-gardless of your size. A feral trance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Con modifier. While in a trance, you cannot perform certain actions, and afterward you are fatigued. These restrictions are the same as those for the barbarian&#39;s rage class feature (PH25&#8212;26). If you have the ability to enter a rage, you can do so while in a feral trance, using your increased Constitution score to determine the duration of both effects.<br />At 3rd level, you can use this ability twice per day.

Furthermore, you cannot purchase food&#8212;you must obtain it by hunting, gathering, begging, or stealing. Some fists of the forest even give up speech, the use of fire and tools, and all possessions, but such extremes are not required. In any month in which you buy food or voluntarily sleep indoors more than three times, all your fist of the forest class features cease to function until you have spent thirty consecutive days living like an animal once more, or until a fellow Guardian of the Green casts <em>atonement</em> on you.",
      "unarmed damage (ex)": "Your unarmed attacks deal more damage than usual. At 1st level, you deal 1d8 points of damage with each unarmed strike. When you attain 3rd level, this damage increases to 1d10 points. See the monk class feature (PH41). If your unarmed attack already deals this amount of damage, increase the base damage to the next step indicated on the monk class table.",
      "uncanny dodge (ex)": "At 2nd level, you cannot be caught flatfooted, and you react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so. See the barbarian class feature (PH26). If you already have uncanny dodge from another class, you instead gain improved uncanny dodge.",
      "untamed strike (su)": "On attaining 2nd level, you can channel the untamed power of nature when you attack. Your unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons; see the monk&#39;s kistrike class feature (PH41). If your unarmed strikes are already magical, they instead are treated lesser ghost touch weapons. They deal full damage against incorporeal creatures 50% of the time and half damage the rest of the time.",
      "scent (su)": "Beginning at 3rd level, you gain the supernatural ability to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. This ability otherwise functions like the extraordinary ability of the same name (MM314)."

      "weapon and armor proficiency": "Fleet runners are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all armor, and with shields (except tower shields).",
      "spells": "At every even level the fleet runner gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of rebuking or controlling undead, wildshape, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a fleet runner, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.",
      "fast movement (ex)": "The fleet runner has a speed faster than what is normal for her race by +10 feet when wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor (and not carrying a heavy load). For example, a human fleet runner in studded leather armor has a standard speed of 40 feet. This increase stacks with similar speed increases, such as from the barbarian or monk classes.",
      "greater mobility (ex)": "A fleet runner of Ehlonna gains a +8 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when she moves out of or within a threatened area. This supercedes the bonus granted by the Mobility feat.",
      "additional domain": "A fleet runner gains access to another of Ehlonna&#39;s domains as a third clerical domain. She can use the granted power of the domain (using her fleet runner level instead of her cleric level), and can choose from the spell lists of three domains when selecting her domain spells for the day. She can still cast only one domain spell of each level (1st through 9th) per day. Fleet runners without a level of cleric gain no benefit from this granted ability.",
      "evasion (ex)": "At 2nd level and above, a fleet runner can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If the fleet runner makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage she instead takes no damage. The fleet runner can use evasion only if she is wearing light armor or no armor.",
      "leap of the hart (ex)": "At 3rd level and higher, a fleet runner makes Jump checks as if she made a running jump regardless of how far she moves (if at all) before leaping.",
      "shot on the run": "At 4th level, the fleet runner gains the Shot on the Run feat, even if she does not meet its prerequisite.",
      "run like the huntress (su)": "At 5th level, a fleet runner gains supernatural stamina while running. She can run for a number of rounds equal to two times her Constitution score without making any checks, and she gains a +8 bonus on Constitution checks made to continue running after that point.",
      "improved evasion (ex)": "At 6th level, a fleet runner&#39;s evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex, but henceforth she only takes half damage on a failed save. The fleet runner can only use Improved Evasion if she wears light armor or no armor.",
      "run like the wind (sp)": "At 7th level, a fleet runner can slip magically between spaces, as per the spell dimension door, once per day as a spell-like ability. The fleet runner&#39;s effective caster level equals her class level.",
      "leopard&#39;s pounce (ex)": "At 8th level, a fleet runner can make a full attack at the end of a charge.",
      "swiftness of the tigress (ex)": "When she reaches 9th level, a fleet runner can act as if under the effects of a haste spell for a total of 1 round per class level per day. These rounds need not be consecutive.",
      "cheetah&#39;s sprint (su)": "Once an hour, a 10th-level fleet runner can take a charge action to move ten times her normal speed."

      "spells": "At every odd-numbered level, a flux adept gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before adding this prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of rebuking or controlling undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a flux adept, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.",
      "grace through will (ex)": "The simplest lesson of the path of the flux adept is the means to precisely control all of the body&#39;s muscles. While this is by no means something that can be mastered immediately, the mind and body can be made, in time, to work as one. The character adds half her flux adept level to all Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, and Tumble skill checks.",
      "pheromonic control (ex)": "At 2nd level, the flux adept learns that beauty is more than skin deep&#8212;it lies at least as deep as the glands. Three times per day, the flux adept may create an affect that functions like eagle&#39;s splendor, as cast by a sorcerer of the flux adept&#39;s class level. In addition, the flux adept gains an additional +2 bonus on any Charisma-based skill check made against a creature with the scent ability.",
      "thermoregulation (su)": "A 2nd-level flux adept can, at will, vary her skin and blood to cope with extremes of temperature, even when these extremes have magical origins. The flux adept gains a +2 bonus on all saves against fire or cold effects, as well as Fortitude saves made in cold or very hot conditions (<span class=\"caps\">DUNGEON</span> MASTER&#39;S Guide, pages 302-303). At 7th level, the bonus increases to +4, and the flux adept is immune to the effects of cold and hot conditions.",
      "iron stomach (su)": "Beginning at 3rd level, the flux adept may draw nutrients out of any substance: bark, grass, stone, gold, and even ash. The adept gains no benefit against poisons delivered by an attack, but becomes immune to all ingested poisons (<span class=\"caps\">DUNGEON</span> MASTER&#39;S Guide, page 297).",
      "bitter tides (ex)": "The 4th-level flux adept now commands the composition of all fluids produced by glands or ducts of the body, such as tears, sweat, and saliva. She gains the ability to make such fluids acidic, and can do so a number of times per day equal to 3 plus her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). With this ability, the flux adept may either spit a single concentrated bolus of acidic saliva or sweat acid for 10 minutes. The acidic spittle deals 3d6 points of acid damage on a successful ranged touch attack (range increment 10 feet). Her acidic sweat deals 1 point of acid damage per round to any object she touches and wishes to affect. In addition, any creature that hits her with a natural weapon suffers 1 point of acid damage per hit. For each minute that she touches an item (such as ropes or shackles binding her, or a wooden door that blocks her path), her acidic sweat ignores 1 point of the object&#39;s hardness.",
      "feign death (ex)": "The 5th-level flux adept is able to turn off her metabolism (requiring no food, water, or even air) by entering a deep trance that resembles death. She can remain in this dormant state for up to 24 hours, and shows all the physical signs of death. She may enter this trance as a standard action. Awakening from the trance takes a full round. Upon entering a trance, the flux adept must designate up to three triggers that will awaken her prematurely. A trigger can only be an event that somehow affects the character (such as being touched, slapped, or damaged), and cannot be something tied to the time of day (such as the sun rising or setting). Triggers cannot depend on he character perceiving her surroundings, such as hearing a sound. If none of her triggers are set off during her trance, the flux adept remains in this state for the full 24 hours. After a full 24 hours of rest in this state, the flux adept heals 2d8 damage and 2 points of damage to each ability score. While in this inert state, her body slowly repairs damage it has suffered.",
      "taste of truth (ex)": "At 6th level, the hormones of the body are now so familiar to the flux adept that she can actually read a creature&#39;s emotions by tasting its infinitesimal hormonal secretions in the air. Against living creatures, the flux adept receives a bonus on all Bluff and Sense Motive checks equal to her flux adept class level. Conditions that would prevent a creature from using the scent ability prevent a flux adept from using this ability.",
      "haste (ex)": "Twice per day as a free action, the 7th-level flux adept may control her adrenaline and muscles to the extent she can act as if she was under the effect of a haste spell, as cast by a sorcerer of her flux adept level.",
      "boiling blood (ex)": "At 8th level, the flux adept has such mastery over her body chemistry that she can cause her hands to bloat with her body&#39;s primal power. Her hands become over-sized claws that grant her a natural attack. This grants the flux adept two claw attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage plus her Strength modifier.",
      "polyhaemia (su)": "This ability allows the 9th-level flux adept to resynthesize potions in her own blood from those that she has consumed in the last 24 hours. Once synthesized, the potion immediately affects the flux adept as if she had just drunk it. This ability requires a Craft (alchemy) check with a DC equal 20 + double the spell&#39;s level. For example, a flux adept attempting to duplicate a potion of blur would need to succeed at DC 22 Craft (alchemy) check. The flux adept may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 plus her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 per day). A failed Craft (alchemy) check still consumes a use of the ability. Each use requires a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity.",
      "regeneration 1 (ex)": "At 10th level, a flux adept&#39;s mastery of the immune and repair systems of the body is such that she gains regeneration 1. Cold, electricity, fire, and sonic deal normal damage to a flux adept. A flux adept can regrow a lost limb or body part in 4d6 days, but cannot reattach the severed member by holding it to the stump."

In addition, a force missile mage&#39;s <em>Magic Missiles</em> might penetrate <em>Shield</em> spells and <em>Brooches of Shielding.</em> Against such protections, the force missile mage makes a caster level check with a DC equal to the caster level, in the case of <em>Shield,</em> or DC 20, in the case of a brooch.",
      "reflective shield (sp)": "At 4th level, a force missile mage can reflect the spell <em>Magic Missile.</em> For the purposes of being affected by <em>Magic Missile,</em> a force missile mage is constantly treated as being under the effect of the spell <em>Spell Turning,</em> thus reflecting offensive <em>Magic missiles</em> back at the caster. If that caster is protected by a <em>Shield</em> spell or a <em>Brooches of Shielding,</em> these reflected <em>Magic Missiles</em> are negated as normal.

In addition to the normal benefits of the feat, the frost mage bypasses all resistances and immunities to cold granted by spells and spell-like effects of magic items (for example, a ring of minor energy resistance [cold]).",

His oneness with cold, however, makes him more susceptible to flame. Just like any other creature with the cold subtype, he gains vulnerability to fire, which means he takes half again as much (+50%) damage as normal from fire, regardless of whether or not a saving throw is allowed, or if the save is a success or a failure."

      "spells per day/spells known": "At each geomancer level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (additional wild shape options, metamagic or item creation feats, or the like). Since the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a geomancer, the player must decide to which class to add each geomancer level for determining spells per day and spells known.",
      "spell versatility": "At 1st level, the geomancer learns to blend divine and arcane magic. He still acquires and prepares his spells in the normal manner for his individual spellcasting classes. When he casts them, however, he can mix or match spellcasting parameters from any of his classes to gain the maximum possible advantage for any spell with a spell level equal to or less than his spell versatility score. Thus, as a 4th-level geomancer, he can cast any of his 3rd-level or lower sorcerer/wizard spells with no chance of arcane spell failure from armor. (The druidic prohibition against metal armor still applies to druid/geomancers, however, since this stricture stems from a spiritual oath rather than a practical limitation.) The geomancer may use his Wisdom modifier to set the save DC for arcane spells, or his Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever he would normally use for arcane spells) to set the save DC for divine spells. If a spell requires either an arcane material component or a divine focus, he may use either. A cleric/geomancer who also has levels of wizard, sorcerer, or bard can spontaneously convert any prepared arcane or divine spell (except a domain spell) of an appropriate level into a cure or inflict spell of equal or lower level, though he must be capable of casting the latter as a cleric.",

Choose one of the following terrain types: aquatic, desert, forest, hills, marsh, mountains, or plains. In that terrain, the geomancer&#39;s effective caster level for all spells increases by +1. At 6th level and again at 10th level, the character may either choose a new terrain in which to receive the benefit (at +1), or increase his effective caster level in a previously chosen terrain by an additional +1."

      "fearlessness (su)": "Because the power of your deity suffuses both your body and your mind, you are immune to fear effects.",
      "spell resistance (su)": "Your deity&#39;s glory makes you more resistant to magic than other mortals. You gain spell resistance equal to 12 + your glorious servitor level.",
      "divine shield (su)": "At 2nd level, you gain a +2 deflection bonus to AC when you are in animal form. this bonus increases to +4 at 4th level and to +6 at 6th level.",
      "increased strength (ex)": "Your connection to the divine grants you great physical strength. At 2nd, 4th, and 6th level, you gain a +1 inherent bonus to Strength in both your normal and your bestial form.",
      "divine voice (ex)": "Beginning at 3rd level, you can speak any languages you know with your normal human voice while in bestial form. This ability allows you to cast spells with verbal components normally while in bestial form, although you cannot cast spells that require somatic components unless you use the Still Spell or Natural Spell feat.",
      "true seeing (sp)": "Upon attaining 3rd level, you gain the ability to use <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/true-seeing--2520/\"><em>true seeing</em></a> once per day (caster level equals your character level).",
      "greater command (sp)": "At 5th level and higher, you can use <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/command-greater--2537/\"><em>greater command</em></a> once per day (caster level equals your character level).",

      "unfaithful servitors": "If you willfully violate the orders of your deity, you lose all supernatural and spell-like abilities of the prestige class and cannot progress further as a glorious servitor. In much the same was as a paladin, you regain your abilities and advancement potential if you atone for your violations. You can also regain your abilities if you switch allegiance to one of your deity&#39;s rivals in the Mulhorandi pantheon-a tactic that earns you the unending enmity of your previous deity&#39;s church."

Once per day, when he would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow struck by a giant, not a spell or special ability), he can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, he makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt; the gnome giant-slayer adds his class level as a bonus on this saving throw). If the save succeeds, he takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, he takes full damage. He must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute his defensive roll&#8212;if he is denied his Dexterity bonus to AC, he can&#39;t use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the character&#39;s evasion or improved evasion ability (if applicable) does not apply to the defensive roll."

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a gray guard, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.",
      "sacrament of trust": "Upon entering this prestige class, you take a vow of allegiance to your faith beyond that of any ordinary paladin. This vow grants you a measure of freedom to act on your cause&#39;s behalf without fear of retribution should your duties require you to break your code of conduct. Dishonorable acts still cause you to lose both gray guard and paladin class features until you atone, but this infraction is considered much less severe than it would be for a paladin.",

Many gray guards use debilitating touch during interrogation, since it reduces the target&#39;s ability to successfully bluff or resist magical effects. Using debilitating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An opponent hit by this attack is sickened for 5 rounds. Using this ability costs 5 points of your daily healing allotment. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) negates the effect.",

Levels of other classes that grant the smite evil class feature stack for the purpose of determining the extra damage dealt. For example, a 5th-level paladin/5th-level gray guard delivering a smite evil attack adds 10 points of damage to the attack.",
      "justice blade (su)": "By 4th level, you have learned that suffering and injustice are not the exclusive province of evil. You can use your smite evil ability to instead punish creatures of chaotic alignment. Using this ability expends one daily use of your smite evil class feature and works identically in all other ways, but its effect applies only to chaotic targets. Whenever you choose to smite an opponent, you must declare whether you are using this ability to smite evil or chaos. If you accidentally smite a creature of an alignment other than that declared, the smite has no effect but the ability is still used up.",
      "devastating touch (su)": "When you attain 5th level, your deity shows its approval of your grim work. From this point on, you can use your lay on hands ability to make a touch attack that harms your enemies. Using devastating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You decide how many points of your daily healing allotment to expend after successfully touching a creature: Each point expended deals 1 point of damage to the target. A nonevil creature is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) to halve the amount of damage dealt.",
      "unbound justice (ex)": "At 7th level, unrestricted by your code of honor, you can employ unorthodox methods that are all the more effective because they&#39;re unexpected. You add half your gray guard level (round down) as a competence bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Intimidate skill checks.",
      "sacrament of the true faith": "At 10th level, you gain your order&#39;s full confidence. You are granted the freedom to act on behalf of your faith as you deem necessary. Thus, you never risk losing your class abilities in the pursuit of a just cause and never need to atone for violating your code of conduct. This trust does not grant you the freedom to act as violently or immorally as you wish, however. Release from your code of conduct depends on your acting as an exemplar of your order&#39;s ideals. If you violate this trust by habitually acting in an immoral or corrupt manner, the leaders or deity of your faith might revoke their blessing and banish you from the ranks of the faithful.",
      "code of conduct": "As a gray guard, you are held to the same code of conduct as a paladin. You must be of lawful good alignment and must never willingly commit an evil act. You must also pledge to respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, cheating, using poison, and the like), aid the needy, and punish those who harm the innocent. If you contravene your code of conduct, you must atone for the transgression or lose all class abilities from both gray guard and paladin levels. As you advance in the prestige class, this code becomes more flexible. However, its tenets still apply: You can never break your code without good reason."

A halfling outrider may, of course, choose to find and train or purchase a more exotic mount. Standard tack and harness is also provided, though, again, the character may wish to purchase masterwork or magic gear. ",

      "defensive riding (ex)": "A halfling outrider of 2nd level or higher knows the tricks of defensive riding. If she does nothing else while mounted (she cannot attack when riding defensively), she gains a +2 bonus on Refl ex saves and a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class. In addition, her mount gains a +20 ft. bonus to its speed, a +2 bonus on all Will saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to its Armor Class.",
      "unbroken charge (ex)": "At 3rd level and higher, a mounted halfling outrider can charge through difficult terrain or squares occupied by friendly creatures by making a DC 15 Ride check. ",
      "stand on mount (ex)": "At 4th level, a mounted halfling outrider becomes able to stand on her mount&#39;s back even during movement or combat, taking no penalties to actions while doing so, by making a DC 20 Ride check. While standing on her mount&#39;s back, a halfling outrider does not take any penalty for using a ranged weapon while her mount is taking a double move or running (see the Mounted Archery feat description, page 98 of the Player&#39;s Handbook).",
      "leap from the saddle (ex)": "A halfling outrider of 5th level or higher can dismount and land adjacent to her mount as a free action by making a DC 20 Ride check. If an opponent is in a square she threatens (after dismounting), she can make a melee attack against that opponent, taking a +2 bonus on the attack roll and a &#8212;2 penalty to Armor Class (just as if the character were making a charge). This ability is usable only if the mount is moving no faster than twice its speed.",
      "evasion (ex)": "At 7th level, a halfling outrider gains the evasion ability. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the halfling outrider is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless halfling outrider (such as one who is unconscious or paralyzed) does not gain the benefit of the ability. ",
      "full mounted attack (ex)": "At 8th level and higher, a halfling outrider may make a full attack when her mount moves more than 5 feet but no more than a single move action. The character cannot combine this full attack with a charge action.",
      "quick turn (ex)": "A 10th-level halfling outrider can make a DC 25 Ride check as a free action to force her mount to execute one change of direction during while running or charging (though the mount must still move at least 10 feet in a straight line after the turn to execute a charge). The turn may be up to 90 degrees, and the mount may make only one such turn per round. If the Ride check fails, the mount moves an extra 10 feet in a straight line and then loses the rest of its actions on this turn."

The spell must be an arcane spell he knows of 2nd level or lower with a casting time of 1 standard action or less. When using his battle-cast ability, a havoc mage may cast spells requiring somatic components even if he has no free hands. Using battle cast does not provoke attacks of opportunity. At 3rd level and higher, a havoc mage can battlecast a spell of 4th level or lower. At 5th level, a havoc mage can battlecast a spell of 8th level or lower.

Activating the aura is a free action, and the aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the hexblade&#39;s Charisma bonus (if any).",

If you prepare your spells in advance and do not have the spontaneous casting ability (as the cleric and druid spellcasting feature, see PH 32 and 35), you can now spontaneously trade prepared spells for spells of an equal or lower level from the Plant domain. If you do have a spontaneous casting ability, you can exchange that one for the ability to cast spontaneously from the Plant domain. Once you make that decision, it cannot be reversed. If you do not already have bonus domain spells, you now gain bonus spells from the Plant domain (see the cleric spellcasting feature, PH 32) as if you were a cleric with access to that domain.

At the end of 10 full minutes of concentration (as the skill), you are affected as if by a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/heal--2398/\">heal</a> spell (PH 239). If you so choose, you can allow others to sit with you in a circle, holding hands, during your communion. In that case, you can choose to divide the hit points and other benefits provided by your communion among the people in the circle. You can divide hit points as if you were using the paladin class feature lay on hands (PH 44). Each other benefit of the <em>heal</em> spell can affect only one person in the circle, at your direction. Thus, only one person can be cured of blindness, and so forth. You do not gain the advantages of any healing benefits that you distribute to others. You can use this ability twice per day at 5th level, three times per day at 7th level, and four times per day at 9th level.",
      "trackless step (ex)": "Beginning at 3rd level, you cannot be tracked in natural surroundings. See the druid class feature (PH 36). If you already have trackless step, you instead gain a +4 bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks while in natural surroundings.",
      "venom immunity (ex)": "At 5th level, you gain immunity to all poisons.",
      "whispers of the forest (su)": "When you attain 6th level, the plants, trees, and rocks begin to speak to you, bringing you news wherever you are. Once per day for every three holt warden levels you possess, the voices of the forest give you a short answer to any simple question you pose pertaining to current events in any wilderness area on your land mass. Questions about distant lands require 1 minute per mile of distance to answer. At the DM&#39;s discretion, when the forest deems an issue particularly important, the whispers bring you news without your request.",
      "web of life (sp)": "At 7th level, you can lead your community in spiritual union with the interconnected web of all life. Once per day, when you sing, chant, or speak inspiringly for at least 1 full minute, every living creature that hears your voice gains a +2 bonus to Wisdom for the next 1d4 hours. In addition, each divine spellcaster who hears you, including yourself, gains back 1d4 levels of spells (up to four 1st-level spells, two 2nd-level spells, one 3rd-level and one 1st-level, or one 4th-level spell). These regained spells must be spells you&#39;ve cast since you last prepared spells. No spellcaster can be affected by this spell-regaining ability more than once per day, even if it is activated by multiple holt wardens.",
      "timeless body (ex)": "Beginning at 9th level, you no longer age. See the druid class feature (PH 37). If you already have timeless body, you can choose an extra feat instead."

To cast a spell, the holy liberator must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell&#39;s level, so a holy liberator with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Holy liberator bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the holy liberator&#39;s Wisdom modifier. When the holy liberator gets 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, he gets only bonus spells.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus metamagic or item creation feats, for example).",
      "school specialization": "Upon becoming an incantatrix, the character chooses to focus her studies on protective and metamagic, forsaking other types of spells. In effect, the incantatrix is a specialist in the school of Abjuration (gaining all the benefits of specializing in a school), and the incantatrix must choose an additional prohibited school or schools using the rules on page 54 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em> (although an incantatrix can never choose Transmutation as an opposed school). The incantatrix can never again learn spells from that prohibited school or schools. She can still use the prohibited spells she knew prior to becoming an incantatrix, including using items that are activated by spell completion or spell trigger. If the incantatrix already is a wizard specialized in Abjuration, she does not need to choose another prohibited school. A bard or sorcerer who becomes an incantatrix must still choose a prohibited school to gain the benefits of specialization.",

She can see ethereal creatures up to 60 feet away, although they appear gray and insubstantial (as objects on the Material Plane appear to ethereal creatures). This does not give her any additional ability to attack ethereal creatures, but she can utilize spells and effects that affect ethereal creatures (such as force effects and abjurations) normally, so she could cast a magic missile at an ethereal creature.",
      "strike ethereal (su)": "Beginning at 4th level, the incantatrix can alter her spells so they strike ethereal targets that she can see. Altering a spell in this way works similar to a sorcerer using a metamagic feat &#8212; spells with a casting time of one action become full-round spells, and spells with a longer casting time take an extra full-round action to cast. The altered spell takes effect on the Ethereal Plane instead of the Material Plane.",
      "hardy spirit (su)": "At 6th level, the incantatrix becomes immune to death effects and energy drain attacks.",
      "instant metamagic (su)": "Once per day, the 7th-level incantatrix can use a single metamagic effect of any metamagic feat she knows on a spell without preparing it beforehand (if a wizard) or increasing its casting time (if a sorcerer or bard). The wizard&#39;s prepared spell works as if prepared with the metamagic feat except it uses the same spell slot. A sorcerer or bard&#39;s spell is cast without the adjustment to the casting time but works as if cast with the metamagic feat. A 9th-level incantatrix can use this power twice per day.",
      "improved metamagic (su)": "At 8th level, the incantatrix has mastered metamagic to such an extent that whenever she uses a metamagic feat, the feat&#39;s level increase upon a spell is reduced by one (this can&#39;t reduce an increase to less than one level, or less than zero levels if the increase is already +0). For example, an incantatrix wizard could prepare a quickened <em>fireball</em> as a 6th-level spell instead of a 7th-level spell.",
      "drain item (sp)": "An incantatrix of 10th level can drain a charge from a charged magic item, using the magic to heal herself. If the item drained is a staff, the spell level is that of the lowest-level spell that uses a single charge. She gains 1d6 hit points per spell level of the charge drained. If the incantatrix has reached her maximum hit points, any additional hit points acquired are temporary hit points (maximum +20) that disappear after 10 minutes. A creature gets to make a Will save (DC 10) to prevent one of its held or carried items from being drained."

      "trap sense (ex)": "An inquisitor gains an intuitive sense that alerts him to danger from traps, giving him a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 tohis AC against attacks by traps. This bonus increases to +2 at 4th level and +3 at 7th level. This bonus stacks with the similar bonus granted by rogue levels.",
      "erudite synergy (ex)": "At 2nd level, the inquisitor selects one of his knowledge skills in which he has 5 or more ranks. So deep is the inquisitor&#39;s knowledge of that subject that he gains an additional +2 bonus on related skill checks. This bonus stacks with the synergy bonus he receives for having 5 or more ranks in a Knowledge skill. At 5th and 8th level, the inquisitor can either select another Knowledge skill in which he has 5 or more ranks and increase his synergy bonus by +2, or he can increase his synergy bonus from the same Knowledge skill by an additional +2.",
      "uncanny dodge (ex)": "An inquisitor has the extraordinary ability to react to danger before he would normally be aware of it. beginning at 3rd level, the inquisitor retains his Dex bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (The inquisitor still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.) If he already has the uncanny dodge ability, he gains improved uncanny dodge instead.",
      "improved uncanny dodge (ex)": "At 6th level, the inquisitor can no longer be flanked, since he can react to multiple opponents as easilty as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies the rogue&#39;s ability to use flank attacks to do a sneak attack on the inquisitor. The exception to this defense is that a rogue at least 4 levels higher than the inquisitor can flank the investigator (and thus sneak attack).",
      "intuitive logic (ex)": "At 10th level, the inquisitor&#39;s keen mind sometimes makes incredibly intuitive leaps of logic. Though not a supernatural ability, it often seems as if the inquisitor has been blessed with knowledge from the gods (or other sources). Once per day, an inquisitor may duplicate the effects of a <em>divination</em> spell (with a base 80% chance of success) and receive a burst of insight regarding a single question. The answer is assembled from disparate information that is brought together in the inquisitor&#39;s mind. The insight requires that he be able to concentrate, uninterrupted, for at least an hour prior to receiving the answer. Any interruption may ruin the attempt, unless the inquisitor succeeds at a Concentration check."

If the invisible blade is caught flat-footed or is otherwise denied his Dexterity modifier to Armor Class, he also loses this bonus.

Multiple wounds from the weapon result in cumulative bleeding loss (two wounds for 2 points of damage per round, and so on). The bleeding can only be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any <em>cure</em> spell or other healing spell (<a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/heal--2398/\"><em>heal</em></a>,<a href=\"/spells/complete-champion--57/healing-circle--597/\"><em>healing circle</em></a>, and so on).

Jesters are proficient with light armor and all shields save for the tower shield. Most jesters prefer light armor that gives them the maximum flexibility needed to perform their acrobatics.",
      "spells": "The jester casts arcane spells in a manner similar to a sorcerer or bard. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a jester must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell&#39;s level. The save DC for the jester&#39;s spells is 10 + the spell&#39;s level + the jester&#39;s Charisma modifier.",
      "jester&#39;s audacity": "The jester&#39;s natural talent for performance, his often outrageous dress, and his seemingly lackadaisical attitude throws his opponents off guard in combat. Even a jester armed with a vicious-looking weapon cuts a comedic figure that many warriors have trouble taking seriously.",
      "jester&#39;s performance": "The jester is the master of the verbal put down, the hilarious joke, or the savage verbal lashing. His words can inspire dread and outrage in his enemies or confidence and comfort in his friends. Once per day per jester level, the jester can use his wit to produce magical effects in those around him. The jester must have at least 1 rank in Perform (comedy) to use these abilities, and many of them rely on the use of that skill to establish their save DCs and other effects. The jester must share a language and be able to speak to the target or targets of his performance abilities unless otherwise noted in the specific ability&#39;s description.",
      "bonus feats": "A jester learns a variety of juggling tricks to entertain his audience. As a result, he develops the reflexes and timing needed to knock fast moving objects out of the air. At 2nd level, a jester with 5 or more ranks in Perform (comedy) gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat.<br />At 6th level, a jester with 9 or more ranks in Perform (comedy) gains Snatch Arrows as a bonus feat. His reflexes and timing improve to the point that he can catch deadly missiles rather than merely knock them aside.",

The jester&#39;s mind-affecting jester&#39;s performance abilities function as normal against undead that possess intelligence scores, although undead creatures gain a +2 bonus on their saves against such abilities. Undead creatures that lack intelligence scores and other types of creatures immune to mind-affecting effects remain immune to the jester&#39;s talents."

Your damage dice stack with any sneak attack damage dice you might have gained from a previous class.",
      "lucky shot (su)": "At 4th level and higher, once per day as a free action, you can gain a +10 insight bonus to one attack roll with your longbow. You must declare the use of this ability before rolling the die.",
      "trackless step (ex)": "At 4th level and higher, you leave no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. You can leave a trail on purpose if you so desire.",
      "poison use (ex)": "At 5th level, you learn to create and/or extract natural poisons and apply them to your weapons without any danger of harming yourself.",
      "steady hand (ex)": "At 6th level, you become able to fire your personal longbow in melee combat without provoking attacks of opportunity. You only gain the benefit of this special ability when wearing light or no armor.",
      "hide in plain sight (ex)": "At 9th level, you gain the ability to hide in plain sight, as the ranger ability described on page 48 of the Player&#39;s Handbook.",
      "death attack (ex)": "At 10th level, you gain the ability to study your victim for 3 rounds and then make a sneak attack with a longbow that, if it successfully deals damage, has the additional effect of possibly either paralyzing or killing the target (your choice). While studying the victim, you can undertake other actions so long as your attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect you or recognize you as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 20 + your Int modifier) against the kill effect, it dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the target is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6+10 rounds. If the target&#39;s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once you have completed the 3 rounds of study, you must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes her save) or if you do not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required before you can attempt another death attack.",
      "poison immunity (ex)": "At 10th level, you gain immunity to all natural poisons and animal venoms. This ability differs from the druid ability of the same name, in that it only applies to poisons derived from natural plants or fungi, or from animal or vermin venoms, not to all poisons, such as venoms from celestial animals or outsiders, or poisons derived from minerals or magic."

A neutral knight wishes to uphold the cause of his liege (if he has one) and win glory. An evil knight seeks to win acclaim across the land and increase her own personal power.

If an opponent attempts to use the Tumble skill to move through your threatened area or your space without provoking attacks of opportunity, the Tumble check DC to avoid your attacks of opportunity increases by an amount equal to your class level.",

Each time this ally takes damage from a physical attack before your next turn, you can take half this damage only absorb damage from physical melee attacks and ranged attacks, such as an incoming arrow or a blow from a sword, not from spells and other effects.",

You must decide whether to use this ability after the attacker determines that an attack has succeeded but before he rolls damage.",

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a knight of the raven, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.",

This creature aids you in combat by distracting foes, and it gains additional abilities as you advance in level. Its statistics are normal for a raven (MM 278) with the celestial template (MM 31), except as noted here. Your raven&#39;s hit point total equals one-half of your full normal hit points. For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice (including the benefits of the celestial template), use your HD total. The raven uses your base saving throw bonuses plus its ability score modifiers (Fort +0, Ref +2, Will +2). It has an Intelligence score of 3. The raven is incredibly agile.

You add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your attack roll and add your knight of the raven class level to your damage roll. If you roll a natural 20 on your smite attack, your bonus damage is doubled. This is not a critical hit, and no confirmation roll is necessary. You must declare that you are using your smite undead ability before you make your attack roll; if the attack misses (or you attack a creature that is not actually undead), your smite is used for the day. If you use this ability against an incorporeal undead creature but your attack fails due to its incorporeality, you can reroll the miss chance once, taking the better result.<br />For every two levels you advance beyond 2nd.

If you already have access to the Sun domain, you can use its granted power twice per day. If you do not have cleric levels, then you can use the granted power of the Sun domain normally. Add the Sun domain&#39;s spells to your class&#39;s spell list.

      "burst of vitality (su)": "At 10th level, you gain the ability to remove negative levels by channeling positive energy, as a standard action, spend a turning attempt and make a turning check. You can remove a number of negative levels from yourself and allies within 30 feet equal to the maximum<br />Hit Dice of undead you could affect (PH 159). For example, if you are a cleric 6/knight of the raven to(effective cleric level 14th) and roll an 18 on your turning check. you could affect undead with up to 16 Hit Dice.

      "weapon and armor proficiency": "A lifedrinker is proficient with no weapons, armor, or shields.",
      "lifewell (ex)": "A lifedrinker stores the life energy that it steals in a reservoir in itself called a lifewell. From this lifewell, the lifedrinker draws the power needed to use their abilities. A lifedrinker gains lifewell points by bestowing negative levels and by dealing Constitution drain. Each negative level bestowed by a vampire&#39;s energy drain ability grants 2 lifewell points. Each point of Constitution drained grants 1 lifewell point. The lifewell of a lifedrinker can hold a maximum of 3 points per lifedrinker level. Lifewell points gained when the lifewell is already full are wasted. ",
      "invigorate (ex)": "A lifedrinker can spend 1 lifewell point to gain 1d6 temporary hit points. These hit points last 24 hours, and while they do not stack with those granted by other sources of temporary hit points, they do stack with more hit points gained from the invigorate ability, so a lifedrinker may spend multiple lifewell points to gain more temporary hit points. No more lifewell points may be spent on this ability in any given day than the lifedrinker has levels.",
      "spell boost (empower) (ex)": "If a lifedrinker of 2nd level or higher casts spells, it may spend 4 lifewell points to empower a spell as if using the Empower Spell feat. The spell slot and level of the spell do not change.",
      "spell boost (heighten) (ex)": "If a lifedrinker of 3rd level or higher casts spells, it may spend a variable number of lifewell points to heighten a spell as if using the Heighten Spell feat. For every 2 lifewell points devoted to the spell boost, the spell&#39;s effective level is treated as one higher for purposes of save DC and other effects. For example, if a lifedrinker spends 4 lifewell points to boost a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\"><em>fireball</em></a> spell, the spell is treated as a 5th-level spell when calculating the Reflex save DC, and the boosted <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\"><em>fireball</em></a> can penetrate a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/globe-of-invulnerability-lesser--2325/\"><em>minor globe of invulnerability</em></a>, which a 3rd-level fireball cannot. The spell slot and level of the spell do not change.",
      "special attack boost (empower)</strong> (ex): a 4th-level lifedrinker can spend 4 lifewell points to empower a special attack, increasing its variable, numeric effects by a factor of 1.5. the special attack is empowered for one use only. for example, a lifedrinker empowering its blood drain ability would drain 1d3 points of constitution, multiplied by 1.5. a lifedrinker could also use this ability to summon more creatures using the children of the night ability it gains as a vampire. some lifedrinkers might have other special abilities that they can use with this ability; a sea hag vampire lifedrinker, for example, could use this to empower her horrific appearance.</p><p><strong>blood servant (ex)": "By spending 10 lifewell points, a 5th-level lifedrinker can call forth a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/planar-ally-lesser--2419/\"><em>lesser planar ally</em></a> (evil only), as per the spell of the same name. The ally automatically serves the lifedrinker for 24 hours. ",
      "boost defenses (ex)": "At 5th level, a lifedrinker can spend 8 lifewell points to add +2 to its natural armor bonus and turn resistance, add +10 to its cold resistance and electricity resistance, and increase its damage reduction to 20/+2. The effect lasts for 24 hours.",
      "spell boost (maximize) (ex)": "If a lifedrinker of 6th level or higher casts spells, it can spend 6 lifewell points to maximize a spell as if using the Maximize Spell feat. The spell slot and level of the spell do not change.",
      "greater blood drain (ex)": "At 7th level, a lifedrinker&#39;s blood drain ability now deals 1d6 points of Constitution drain.",
      "special attack boost (maximize) (ex)": "A lifedrinker of 7th level or higher can spend 6 lifewell points to maximize all variable, numeric effects of a special attack. The special attack is maximized for one use only. A lifedrinker using this ability to maximize its greater blood drain ability, for example, would deal 6 points of Constitution drain. A lifedrinker could also use this ability to summon a maximum number of creatures using the children of the night ability it gains as a vampire. Some lifedrinkers might have other special abilities that they can boost in a similar fashion. ",
      "spell boost (quicken) (ex)": "If a lifedrinker of 8th level or higher casts spells, it can spend 8 lifewell points to quicken one of its spells, as if using the Quicken Spell feat. The spell slot and level of the spell do not change. ",
      "greater invigorate (ex)": "Whenever a 9th-level lifedrinker uses its invigorate ability, it gains a +1 enchantment bonus to Strength for each lifewell point spent. If multiple lifewell points are spent at the same time, the bonus is correspondingly larger. A lifedrinker that spends 10 lifewell points all at once on invigorate gains 10d6 temporary hit points and +10 enchantment bonus to Strength. But if the lifedrinker spends 5 lifewell points in one round and 5 more points in the next, it has 10d6 temporary hit points but only +5 enchantment bonus to Strength. The bonus to Strength lasts for 24 hours. ",
      "blood revel (ex)": "Once a 10th-level lifedrinker drains any blood from a victim, it can choose to enter a state called a blood revel as a free action at the beginning of its next turn and remain in that state for 10 rounds. In this state, the lifedrinker gains a +4 profane bonus to Strength, its damage reduction increases to 25/+3, its fast healing increases to 10 hit points per round, and it may ignore its weakness toward garlic, mirrors, holy symbols, and running water, as well as its vulnerability to sunlight."

      "locate potable water (su)": "This ability is similar to the <a href=\"/spells/sandstorm--85/locate-water--3150/\">locate water</a> spell (see page 117), but in addition to determining the size and distance of water bodies, you can tell whether the water is drinkable. If it is not drinkable, you can sense the reason, such as salt, poison, infectious organisms, or magical fouling. The ability takes a fullround action to initiate and lasts for 10 minutes.",
      "heat endurance": "You gain Heat Endurance as a bonus feat. If you already have the Heat Endurance feat, you instead gain Improved Heat Endurance. ",
      "release the water within (sp)": "Starting at 2nd level, you can painfully extract water from living creatures once per day, creating a puddle at their feet. When you use this ability, a living creature you target within 30 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + lord of tides level + your Wis modifier) or take 1d8 points of dessication damage per lord of tides level. This dessication damage cannot be healed (even with cure magic) until the creature drinks at least 1 quart of water. Creatures that fail their saves take damage and are fatigued until they drink a quart of water. If you kill a living creature with this ability, the puddle of water around the body animates 1 round later into a water mephit, which you can control for up to 1 minute per lord of tides class level. After the duration has expired, the mephit collapses back into a puddle of inanimate water. At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, you gain more daily uses of this ability.",
      "burrow (ex)": "On attaining 3rd level, you gain a burrow speed of 5 feet. This ability allows movement only through relatively soft materials, such as earth and sand. Many dungeon floors and buildings are made of stone, which you cannot pass through with this ability. You do not gain any special ability to avoid suffocation. ",
      "summon elemental (sp)": "Beginning at 6th level, you are able to summon a Large elemental once per day, which must have the water subtype. The ability is otherwise identical to the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/summon-monster-vi--2446/\">summon monster VI</a> spell (see page 287 of the Player&#39;s Handbook). When you reach 8th level, this ability improves: You can summon either an elder elemental once per day or a Large elemental three times per day, which can have the water or fire subtype. The ability is otherwise identical to the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/summon-monster-ix--2449/\">summon monster IX</a> spell (see page 288 of the Player&#39;s Handbook). Your effective caster level for this ability is equal to 10 + your lord of tides class level. ",
      "elemental jaunt (su)": "At 9th level you gain the ability to shift to an elemental plane for short times, once per day as a standard action. This ability is similar to the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/plane-shift--2423/\">plane shift</a> spell (see page 262 of the Player&#39;s Handbook), but you and up to eight willing creatures remain on the elemental plane for up to 1 minute per lord of tides class level. This ability grants no protection against the environmental hazards of the chosen plane. ",
      "elemental portal (su)": "This ability is the pinnacle of the art embodied in the lord of tides class. When you reach 10th level, you can create a limited-use portal between the Material Plane and a location of your choice that you have visited on any elemental plane. The portal appears as a two-dimensional circular aperture with a radius of 10 feet, which resembles an eddy of colored water standing vertically in the air. The color of the water depends on the plane to which the portal connects: pale blue for the Elemental Plane of Air, green for the Elemental Plane of Earth, red for the Elemental Plane of Fire, and deep blue for the Elemental Plane of Water. The portal you bring into being is usable twice per day and is keyed to a special object you make as part of the creation process. The possessor of this portal key can activate the portal and pass through it as a standard action. Any other creatures wishing to pass through must do so within 1 round after the key-holder opens it. Once the portal is open, touching or passing through it instantly transports a creature to the elemental plane, provided the creature fits within its physical dimensions. The portal grants no protection against the environmental hazards of that plane. A solid object at the destination point prevents the portal&#39;s operation, but not the presence of a creature (the traveler is instead transported to the closest possible space to the original destination). Unattended objects cannot pass through a portal, but a traveler can carry up to 850 pounds of equipment."

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If youhad more than one spellcasting class before becoming a malconvoker, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.",
      "deceptive summons (su)": "At 1st level, you can attempt to trick evil creatures you conjure into serving you for longer than they normally would. When casting a <em>summon monster</em> spell to summon an evil-aligned creature, you can attempt a Bluff check as a free action, opposed by the creature&#39;s Sense Motive check. If your check succeeds, the duration of the effect is doubled (as if by the Extend Spell feat), and the summoned creature might be subject to additional effects as described below. If it fails, the duration remains as normal and no additional effects can be applied. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the creature breaks free of your control and is hostile toward you (though it still disappears as normal when the spell&#39;s duration ends). If you use this ability when summoning multiple creatures, you must attempt an opposed skill check separately against each creature you wish to affect.",

In addition, regular use of conjuration spells with the evil descriptor does not threaten to change your alignment. For example, a good cleric who becomes a malconvoker could cast <em>summon monster I</em> to summon a fiendish raven (whose alignment gives the spell the evil descriptor). The cleric could not cast <em>death knell</em>, though, which has the evil descriptor but is not of the conjuration school.",

If you already have one or more of these spells on your class list at a different level, treat it as being of the lower level.",

Upon calling an evil outsider using a planar binding spell, you can make a Bluff check opposed by the creature&#39;s Sense Motive skill check.",
      "improved calling (su)": "At 8th level, your understanding of the ways of fiends shows you how to tempt even more powerful beings into your service. The normal HD limit for your planar ally and planar binding spells (including lesser and greater versions) increases by 2.",

The marshal may project one minor aura and (starting at 2nd level) one major aura at a time.<br />Projecting an aura is a swift action. The aura remains in effect until the marshal uses a free action to dismiss it or activates another aura of the same kind (major or minor). A marshal can have an aura active continually; thus, an aura can be in effect at the start of a combat encounter even before the marshal takes his first turn.",

Once per day, as a standard action, he may grant an extra move action to any or all of his allies within 30 feet (but not to himself). Each of the affected allies takes this extra move action immediately, acting in their current initiative order.<br />This extra action does not affect the allies&#39; initiative count; the round continues normally after the marshal&#39;s turn is over. (This may mean, for example, that an ally whose initiative count immediately follows the marshal&#39;s may get an extra move action from the marshal, followed directly by a full round worth of actions on the ally&#39;s turn.)"

He adds his levels in master of the unseen hand to his caster level (whether from actual spellcasting levels or determined by the spell-like ability) when using his telekinesis ability. For example, a 10th-level sorcerer/3rd-level master of the unseen hand casts telekinesis as a 13th-level caster, and a blue slaad who is a 2nd-level master of the unseen hand would use its telekinesis spell-like ability as a 10th-level caster.",
      "versatile telekinesis (ex)": "A master of the unseen hand learns to combine the three versions of the telekinesis spell or ability, switching from one to another as he likes. For instance, he can use sustained force for 2 rounds, then switch to combat maneuver, then return to using sustained force. The spell or spell-like ability ends after the first use of the violent thrust version, however, or if the master of the unseen hand is unable to maintain concentration.",
      "telekinetic wielder (ex)": "A master of the unseen hand develops the ability to wield weapons with his telekinetic power. By maintaining concentration on the combat maneuver version of telekinesis, a master of the unseen hand of 2nd level or higher can make a single attack with an unattended weapon or one he is holding, moving the weapon up to 20 feet before the attack. Resolve the attack as normal, except that the weapon&#39;s movement doesn&#39;t provoke attacks of opportunity. The master of the unseen hand&#39;s base attack bonus on this attempt is equal to his caster level plus his Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer or a creature with the telekinesis supernatural or spell-like ability). Any weapon-related feats the master of the unseen hand has (such as <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/weapon-focus--3105/\">Weapon Focus</a> and <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/power-attack--2208/\">Power Attack</a>) do not apply when he&#39;s telekinetically wielding a weapon.",
      "sustained concentration (ex)": "At 2nd level, a master of the unseen hand becomes adept at moving and fighting while maintaining his telekinesis ability. It only takes a move action, not a standard action, to use the sustained force version of telekinesis (or simply to maintain concentration so the ability doesn&#39;t end). The master of the unseen hand can even cast another spell while maintaining concentration on telekinesis, but doing so requires a successful Concentration check as if the caster were distracted by a nondamaging spell (Concentration check DC equal to the save DC of telekinesis). It still takes a standard action to use the combat maneuver or violent thrust versions of the ability, however.",
      "full attack telekinesis (ex)": "At 3rd level, a master of the unseen hand is as skilled in telekinetic combat as a fighter is with melee combat. When using the combat maneuver version of telekinesis or wielding a weapon telekinetically, the master of the unseen hand can make a full attack, potentially attacking, bull rushing, disarming, grappling, or tripping more than once per round. Just as with nontelekinetic attacks, the master of the unseen hand gains an additional attack for every 5 points of base attack bonus above +1 (using caster level for base attack bonus as described in the telekinesis spell description).",
      "improved violent thrust (ex)": "At 4th level, a master of the unseen hand&#39;s violent thrust version of telekinesis becomes more effective. He uses his caster level in place of his base attack bonus when making the attack roll, and he uses his Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer or a creature with the telekinesis supernatural or spell-like ability) as a bonus on damage rolls if he hurls weapons at the target. Finally, using a violent thrust no longer ends the telekinesis effect, but the master of the unseen hand can&#39;t make another violent thrust for 1d4 rounds. ",
      "telekinetic flight (ex)": "A master of the unseen hand of 4th level or higher can use the sustained force version of telekinesis to lift himself and willing creatures into the air. With a move action, the master of the unseen hand can move 20 feet with perfect maneuverability and can move willing creatures as well. The master of the unseen hand doesn&#39;t have to move all the creatures he&#39;s lifting in the same direction, but any lifted creatures plummet to the ground if they move more than 40 feet from the master of the unseen hand. The master of the unseen hand can lift one Medium or smaller creature (carrying up to its maximum load) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. Unlike the form of flight granted by the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fly--2816/\"><em>fly</em></a> spell, telekinetic flight ends immediately and abruptly if disrupted by dispel magic or a lapse in the master of the unseen hand&#39;s concentration. Without telekinesis to support them, creatures fall to the ground immediately, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen (maximum 20d6).",
      "fling skyward (ex)": "Rather than hurling a creature toward another target, a 5th-level master of the unseen hand can use the violent thrust version of telekinesis to hurl a creature straight up. A target is allowed a Will save (and spell resistance) to negate the effect. The master of the unseen hand can lift a creature into the air a maximum distance of 10 feet per caster level. At the beginning of the character&#39;s next action, the creature falls to the ground, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen. Unlike other times when a master of the unseen hand uses the violent thrust version of telekinesis, flinging a foe skyward immediately ends the telekinesis effect."

The monk can use this supernatural ability once per round, up to a number of times per day equal to 1 + his Enabled Hand class level. The Enabled Hand monk must declare he is using a shim soo attack before making the attack roll (thus, a missed attack ruins the attempt).

The monk must declare he is using a dragon&#39;s tail slap before making the attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). If a foe is struck by a monk of the Enabled Hand, the monk automatically initiates a bull rush attack (Player&#39;s Handbook, page 154), except as follows. The Enabled Hand monk and his foe make opposed Strength checks. The Enabled Hand monk is treated as if he were one size category larger than his actual size for purposes of determining his size-category bonus on the opposed Strength check. In addition, the monk also automatically gains a +4 bonus from his lung soo training.<br />The foe takes an additional amount of damage from the attack equal to the number of feet she is knocked back. The Enabled Hand monk doesn&#39;t move when his foe is knocked back. The foe may provoke attacks of opportunity when he is knocked back (although not from the monk), but the monk is not subject to attacks of opportunity because he doesn&#39;t move (unlike a standard bull rush). If the monk fails the opposed check, he suffers no deleterious effect."

To cast a spell, the mortal hunter must have a Charisma score of at least 10 + the spell&#39;s level, so a mortal hunter with a Charisma of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Mortal hunter bonus spells are based on Charisma, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + Cha modifier. When Table 5&#8212;10 shows 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, the mortal hunter gets only bonus spells. A mortal hunter without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level.

A mortal hunter casts spells just as a sorcerer does.",

The damage bonus applies to ranged weapons only against targets within 30 feet (the mortal hunter cannot strike with deadly accuracy beyond that range). The bonus does not apply to damage against creatures that are immune to critical hits. At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the mortal hunter&#39;s bonus associated with mortals goes up by +1. This bonus stacks with a ranger&#39;s favored enemy bonus.",

If the flesh is not the same type as the form adopted, the duration is 10 minutes. In all cases, the mortal hunter can dismiss the ability as a standard action. Otherwise, this ability works as the <a href=\"/spells/tome-and-blood-a-guidebook-to-wizards-and-sorcerers--51/polymorph-self--3422/\"><em>polymorph self</em></a> spell, and the mortal hunter can call upon it once per day.",

If the mortal hunter accidentally smites a creature that is not a mortal, the smite has no effect but is still used up for that day.",

In no case, however, does she gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained, except for an increased effective level of spellcasting.

As a result, all animals except for bats, rats, and wolves have their initial attitudes moved down one category when you first approach them. In addition, you take a &#8212;2 penalty on all Ride checks due to the beast&#39;s inherent nervousness at your presence.",
      "hesitating stare (su)": "Deathbringers can force their opponents to confront their own mortality with but a glance. This ability can be activated once per day at any time, even when you are surprised. You cast a glance at any foe within 30 feet, who must then make a successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your class level + Cha modifier) or be stunned for 1 round. You can use this ability twice per day at 4th level and higher, three times per day at 7th level and higher, and four times per day at 10th level.",
      "light sensivity (ex)": "In sunlight or bright magical light (such as a daylight spell), a deathbringer is dazzled.",
      "spider climb (sp)": "Starting at 1st level, you can act as if you were under the influence of a <em>spider climb</em> spell (caster level equals your deathbringer class level). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, minimum one.",
      "feral senses": "At 2nd level, you gain low-light vision &#8211; the ability to see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, or similar conditions of poor illumination. You retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions. At 7th level, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet.",
      "speak with creatures of the night (ex)": "When you reach 3rd level, you can speak with rats, bats, and wolves as if you were under the influence of a <em>speak with animals</em> spell. This ability does nothing to affect the attitude of such creatures.",
      "ghost step (su)": "Once per day starting at 3rd level, you can make yourself invisible for 1 round. This is a swift action (something you can do as a free action once per round) that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You can use this ability twice per day at 6th level and higher, and three times per day at 9th level and higher.",
      "lesser blood bond (su)": "One of the deathbringer&#39;s most insidious powers, this ability helps you break down the will of her enemies. To use this ability, a deathbringer of 4th level or higher must get the target to drink three drops of her blood. She can do this by hiding the blood in food or drink, or by pinning the target for 1 round and bleeding directly into his mouth.",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "At 4th level and higher, you deal extra damage when you catch a foe flat-footed or flank a foe, as the rogue class feature described on page 50 of the Player&#39;s Handbook. Sneak-attack dice attained from multiple sources stack.",
      "improved evasion (ex)": "At 5th level, your pseudo-vampiric celerity grants you supernatural reflexes. You now take no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against area attacks and half damage on a failed save. You do not gain the benefit of this ability if you are helpless.",
      "slippery mind (su)": "When you attain 6th level, your mind is only partly mortal, allowing you to shrug off mental attacks and compulsions more easily than others. Any time you are affected by an enchantment spell or effect and you fail your saving throw, you can attempt the save again 1 round later at the same DC. You only get one extra chance to succeed per effect.",
      "greater blood bond (su)": "This ability, acquired at 10th level, works just like lesser blood bond, except the target comes under the influence of a <em>dominate person</em> spell rather than <em>charm person</em>. A deathbringer can have a number of outstanding blood bonds, active or not, equal to her Charisma modifier. Should she exceed this limit, the oldest blood bond becomes inactive."

Even if the save succeeds, the subject is panicked for 1 round. Any creature whose Hit Dice exceed twice your character level is unaffected by this power. This is a mind-affecting fear death effect.

She can use the Search skill to find, and the Disable Device skill to disarm, magic traps (DC 25 + the level of the spell used to create it).

      "skill mastery (ex)": "At 6th level, a nightsong infiltrator has become so confident in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. When making a Climb, Disable Device, Open Lock, or Search check, she can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. ",

If the ninja makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Even if he fails his saving throw, he takes only half damage from the attack. The ninja can only use improved evasion if he is wearing light armor or no armor.",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "If a ninja spy can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the ninja&#39;s target would be denied her Dexterity bonus to AC (whether she actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks the target, the ninja&#39;s attack deals extra damage. The extra damage is +1d6 at 2nd level and an additional 1d6 every three levels thereafter. This extra damage stacks with any extra sneak attack damage the character already deals. Thus, a 7th-level rogue/5th-level ninja deals +6d6 damage with a sneak attack: +4d6 from his rogue levels and +2d6 from his ninja levels.",
      "acrobatics (su)": "A 3rd-level ninja spy gains a +10 competence bonus on Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble checks. At 7th level, this bonus increases to +20. In addition, a ninja can always choose to take 10 on a Balance, Climb, Jump, or Tumble check, even when circumstances would normally prevent him from doing so.",
      "leap of the clouds (su)": "A 3rd-level ninja spy&#39;s jumping distance (vertical or horizontal) is not limited according to his height.",
      "hide in plain sight (su)": "A 4th-level ninja spy can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, a ninja spy can hide himself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. A ninja spy cannot, however, hide in his own shadow.",
      "water walk (su)": "A ninja spy of 5th level or higher can use water walk to walk on any liquid as if it were firm ground. The ninja must concentrate (as a standard action) to perform this ability, and thus can only take a single move or move-equivalent action each round while water walking. The effect lasts for 1 round per ninja level.",
      "thousand faces (su)": "At 7th level, a ninja spy gains the ability to change his appearance at will, as if using the spell <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/alter-self--2774/\"><em>alter self</em></a>.",
      "poison immunity (su)": "A ninja spy of 8th level or higher is immune to all poisons.",
      "slippery mind (ex)": "At 9th level, a ninja spy gains the ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel him. If a ninja with slippery mind is affected by a spell and fails his saving throw, he can attempt his saving throw again in the next round. He only gets this one extra chance to succeed at his saving throw.",
      "abundant step (sp)": "A ninja spy of 10th level can slip magically between spaces, as per the spell <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dimension-door--2388/\"><em>dimension door</em></a>, once per day. The ninja&#39;s effective caster level is 5th."

If this particular weapon is lost or destroyed, the occult slayer loses the ability to deal the extra damage until she acquires and bonds with another weapon of the same kind of at least masterwork quality. The occult slayer must spend one day per character level practicing with the replacement weapon (and doing very little else&#8212;no adventuring) to create a new weapon bond.",
      "mind over magic (su)": "Starting at 2nd level, an occult slayer can cause a spell or spell-like ability targeted against her to rebound onto the originator as a free action. This ability otherwise functions as the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/spell-turning--2368/\"><em>spell turning</em></a> spell (caster level equals the character&#39;s occult slayer level + 5). An occult slayer can use this ability once per day at 2nd level and twice per day at 4th level.",
      "vicious strike (ex)": "At 2nd level and higher, an occult slayer who readies an attack action to disrupt a spellcaster deals double damage if the attack hits.",
      "auravision (su)": "At 3rd level, an occult slayer gains the ability to see magical auras at a range of up to 60 feet as a free action. This ability otherwise functions as the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/detect-magic--2489/\"><em>detect magic</em></a> spell. The character cannot use this ability to determine anything but the number of magical auras present.",
      "nondetection cloak (su)": "Upon reaching 4th level, an occult slayer (and any gear she wears or carries) becomes more difficult to locate through divinations such as clairaudience/clairvoyance, locate object, and other detection spells. The occult slayer gains magical protection from divinations equivalent to a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/nondetection--2341/\"><em>nondetection</em></a> spell (caster level equals the character&#39;s occult slayer level), except that it affects only the occult slayer and her possessions.",
      "blank thoughts (ex)": "At 5th level, an occult slayer can induce within herself a state of mental absence, thereby becoming immune to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, patterns, phantasms, and morale effects). She can suppress or resume this ability as a free action."

      "continued advancement": "Levels in ordained champion stack with levels of other appropriate classes for the purpose of turning or rebuking undead, and for all level-dependent domain granted powers.",
      "modified spontaneous casting (ex)": "If you have cleric levels, you lose the ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells. Instead, you can swap out previously prepared cleric spells for any spells of equal or lower level from the War domain. This alteration applies even to levels you gain as a cleric after becoming an ordained champion. If you are not a cleric, modified spontaneous casting does not apply to you, even if you can spontaneously cast some other kind of spell, such as summon nature&#39;s ally.",
      "diehard": "At 2nd level, you gain Diehard as a bonus feat, even if you lack the prerequisites. If you already have Diehard, you can select any other feat for which you meet the prerequisites as your bonus feat.",
      "smite (su)": "At 2nd level, you can spend one daily use of your turn/rebuke undead ability as a swift action to turn your next melee attack into a smite. You gain a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on attack rolls, and you deal extra damage equal to your total effective turning or rebuking level. Your smite attack is not limited by alignment or race; you can attempt to smite any foe. Except as noted here, this ability functions like the paladin&#39;s smite evil ability (PH 44).",
      "channel spell (sp)": "At 3rd level, you can channel any spell you have available to cast into your melee weapon. Doing so requires a move action and uses up a prepared spell or spell slot just as if you had cast the spell. The channeled spell affects the next target you successfully attack with that weapon, though saving throws and spell resistance still apply normally. Even if the spell normally affects an area or is a ray, it still affects only the target in this case. On a successful hit, the spell is discharged from the weapon, which can then hold another spell. You can channel your spells into only one weapon at a time. A spell channeled into a weapon is lost if not used within 8 hours.",
      "divine bulwark (sp)": "At 3rd level, you can sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot as a swift action to gain damage reduction. The value of the damage reduction equals 1 + spell level sacrificed, and it can be overcome by a chaoticaligned strike. Thus, a 3rd-level ordained champion who sacrificed a flame strike spell would gain damage reduction 6/chaotic for 3 rounds. The damage reduction gained from multiple uses of this ability does not stack. This protection lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ordained champion level.",
      "fist of the gods (sp)": "At 4th level, you can sacrifice a prepared spell or spell slot as a swift action to deal extra damage. Doing so grants you a bonus equal to 1 + spell level sacrificed on your damage rolls for melee attacks. This benefit lasts for a number of rounds equal to your ordained champion level.",
      "rapid spontaneous casting (ex)": "When you attain 4th level, any spell from the War domain that you spontaneously cast requires only a swift action if its normal casting time is no more than 1 standard action, or a standard action if its normal casting time is 1 full-round action. A spontaneous spell that you modify with a metamagic feat requires only its normal casting time rather than the extra time such a spell normally requires.",
      "holy warrior (sp)": "At 5th level, you can spend one daily use of your turn/rebuke undead ability as a swift action to bring your Wisdom into play in combat. For 5 rounds after you activate this ability, you can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier on attack rolls and damage rolls.",
      "war caster (ex)": "At 5th level, you gain a +2 bonus to your effective caster level when casting spells that appear on the War domain spell list."

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of rebuking or controlling undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming an osteomancer, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.",

He becomes able to travel at a speed of 10 feet through muscular control taught to all novice osteomancers (he may not run). The osteomancer may now fit in minute spaces and crawl under barriers, with one important caveat: the osteomancer must at all times take care to protect his organs, making sure they are not squashed or crushed. For simplicity&#39;s sake, assume the osteomancer cannot travel through any space smaller than 6 inches in diameter.",

The protruding bones act as armor spikes and spiked gauntlets. The osteomancer is automatically proficient in the weapons forged directly from his own skeleton, but not the normal weapons of the same type. Note that while normal bone is far more fragile than any forged weapon, the osteomancer&#39;s supernatural skill causes his exposed bones to have the strength of steel. He may use this ability at will. As natural weapons, the osteomancer&#39;s bone spurs cannot be sundered.",
      "unnerve (su)": "As an extension of the above ability, an osteomancer may sculpt his protruding bone into terrifying shapes, such as sinister leering faces. Creatures within 30 feet of the osteomancer attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the osteomancer, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + osteomancer level + Charisma modifier). If the save succeeds, the opponent is unaffected and immune to that particular osteomancer&#39;s unnerve effect for 24 hours. If the save fails, the opponent suffers a -2 penalty on every attack roll against the osteomancer for the next 24 hours. A creature only has to make one save against a particular osteomancer per 24 hour period. This is a mind-affecting, fear effect.",
      "enlarge/reduce (sp)": "Beginning at 4th level, once per day, the osteomancer may cast enlarge person or reduce person on himself as cast by a sorcerer of the osteomancer&#39;s class level. He gains one daily use of each spell.",

He can affect up to one creature per osteomancer level within 60 feet, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. Each subject is allowed a Fortitude save (DC 10 + osteomancer level + Charisma modifier). Creatures without skeletons (such as oozes) are not affected. Subjects affected by this ability are held immobile as though paralyzed. As this ability targets the bone structure of a being, rather than its mind, corporeal undead are subject to its effect. A winged creature affected by this ability cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer cannot swim and might drown. Creatures immune to paralysis are not immune to this effect.",
      "silver bones (su)": "A 5th-level osteomancer&#39;s bone spurs act as both silver and cold iron weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
      "aligned bones (su)": "At 6th level, an osteomancer&#39;s bone spurs take on any nonneutral alignment the character has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. For example, a lawful neutral osteomancer&#39;s bone spurs act as lawful weapons. A wholly neutral osteomancer must choose for his bone spurs to be chaotic, evil, good, or lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Once chosen, this alignment component cannot be changed.",
      "adamantine bones (su)": "A 7th-level osteomancer&#39;s bone spurs act as adamantine, cold iron, and silver weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.",
      "sap life (su)": "As a touch attack, an 8th-level osteomancer can cause a malaise to settle into the core of an opponent&#39;s bones. This effect deals 2d4 points of Strength damage unless the opponent makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + osteomancer level + Charisma modifier). The osteomancer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 plus his Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This ability can only affect living creatures with a skeleton.",
      "wield the core (su)": "At 9th level, the osteomancer can telepathically control the physical actions of any creature with a skeleton. The target creature must be within 30 feet, and is allowed a Fortitude save (DC 10 + osteomancer level + Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. On a failed save, the osteomancer can control the movements of the subject by forcing its bones to move however the osteomancer wills. The effect only allows the osteomancer to controle the movement of the creature&#39;s bone structure, and not its mind. Thus, the osteomancer cannot make the controlled creature speak, but he can cause the creature&#39;s jaws to clench shut, which would prevent a character from casting a spell with a verbal component or using an item that has a command word. This effect lasts for 1 minute per osteomancer level. Obviously self-destructive commands, such as forcing the creature to walk off a cliff or jump into lava, end the effect. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as the osteomancer has line of effect to the subject. Because the osteomancer must remain in line of effect (and therefore potentially keeping himself in harm&#39;s way), commanding a creature to face an obviously superior foe does not end the effect. As this power targets the bone structure of a being, rather than its mind, corporeal undead are subject to its effect. The osteomancer can use this power three times per day.",
      "osteophage (su)": "This 10th-level ability is the most lethal power at the osteomancer&#39;s command. Once per day, an osteomancer can cause the skeleton of a target to liquefy in a matter of seconds, causing the target to collapse in on itself This collapse causes instant death on a failed Fortitude save (DC 15 + Charisma modifier); a successful save prevents skeletal collapse but still deals 10d6points of damage."

      "ranged sneak attack (ex)": "When wearing light armor or no armor, a peerless archer can draw and fire in a split second, catching her targets unawares. She loses this special ability when fighting in medium or heavy armor. At 1st level, a peerless archer gains the ability to execute a ranged sneak attack if she catches an opponent unable to defend himself from attack. Any time the peerless archer&#39;s opponent would be denied his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether he actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the peerless archer&#39;s ranged attack deals +1d6 points of extra damage. This extra damage increases to +2d6 at 4th level, +3d6 at 7th level, and +4d6 at 10th level. Should the peerless archer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so her ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is no farther than 30 feet away. A peerless archer can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies&#8212;undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to strike. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. The peerless archer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot. The peerless archer cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment (unless her sharp shooting ability overcomes the concealment; see below) or by striking at the limbs of a creature whose vitals are not in her line of sight. If the peerless archer gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack.",
      "sharp shooting (ex)": "A peerless archer&#39;s skill with her bow allows her to strike accurately at foes, even when they are attempting to take advantage of cover or concealment. Beginning at 2nd level, a peerless archer&#39;s targets receive cover or concealment one step worse than they should. For example, a target with three-quarters cover is treated as if he had one-half cover. At 5th level, a peerless archer ignores two steps of cover or concealment, so the same target would be treated as if he had one- quarter cover instead of three quarters cover. At 9th level, a peerless archer ignores three steps of cover or concealment. This ability has no effect against foes with total cover.",
      "fletching (su)": "At 2nd level, a peerless archer gains the ability to create magic arrows (and only arrows) with a +1 enhancement bonus, as if she possessed the <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/craft-magic-arms-and-armor--462/\">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a> feat and met all other requirements for the arrow she wishes to make. At 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th levels, the bonus of the arrows she can create with this ability increases to +2, +3, +4, and +5, respectively. "

    "class features": {
      "weapon and armor proficiency": "Primevals gain no proficiency with weapons, armor, or shields. (They are proficient with their natural weapons while in primeval form, though.)",
      "primeval form (su)": "The primary ability of the primeval is the supernatural ability to assume an alternate form. This functions similarly to the druid&#39;s wild shape ability, except the alternate form chosen must be selected when the character takes his first level of primeval and cannot be changed after that. Each time the character changes form with this ability, he assumes the same form. At 1st level, he may change shape into his primeval form once per day. He can use this ability one additional time each day at 4th level, 7th level, and again at 10th level. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. It lasts for 1 minute per primeval level, or until he changes back. Changing form (into either form) is a standard action and doesn&#39;t provoke attacks of opportunity. The primeval does not assume the animal&#39;s physical ability scores. Instead, he adds the animal&#39;s ability score &#8212;10 (for even scores) or &#8212;11 (for odd scores) to his own ability scores. For example, a primeval with a Strength score of 16 who assumes the form of a dire lion (Strength 25) adds +14 to his normal Strength of 16 to determine his Strength score in his primeval form. Remember, items that enhance the character&#39;s ability scores may be rendered inoperative by his change in form. The primeval loses his ability to speak while in primeval form because he is limited to the sounds that the form can make naturally. The primeval form chosen must be a prehistoric animal of some sort (dinosaur, dire animal, or other creature approved by the DM). The primeval form chosen must have no more than 8 HD and cannot be more than one size category larger than the primeval (so a Small character is limited to Medium animals or smaller, and a Medium character is limited to Large or smaller animals). The primeval form can be from any terrain familiar to the character. Appropriate primeval forms for a frostfell environment from the Monster Manual and this book include the dire lion, dire wolf, dire wolverine, and megaloceros. If the primeval has the wild shape ability from other class levels, he may use wild shape to assume his primeval form. He cannot use his primeval form ability to wild shape, however.",
      "animal empathy (ex)": "In any form, the primeval can communicate with animals of his chosen primeval form (or related types). For example, a primeval whose primeval form is a dire wolf may communicate with wolves and dire wolves. He gains a +4 bonus on charisma-based checks against animals of his chosen primeval form and related animals.",
      "regression (su)": "As a primeval gains levels, he begins to physically regress into a more primal, feral version of himself. At 2nd level, the primeval reduces his Intelligence and Charisma scores by 1 point (to a minimum of 3) and gains 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom. At 5th level, he repeats his regression, losing an additional point of Intelligence and Charisma, and gaining an additional point to the rest of his ability scores. At 8th level, the primeval regresses again, losing a third point of Intelligence and Charisma but gaining a third point to the rest of his ability scores.",
      "low-light vision (ex)": "In any form, the primeval gains low-light vision at 2nd level. He can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions. If the primeval already has racial low-light vision, he can instead see four times as far as a human.",
      "feral power (ex)": "As the primeval gains levels, his primeval form grows stronger and tougher, as shown below:",
      "scent (ex)": "At 5th level, the primeval form gains the scent special quality in any form.",
      "fast movement (ex)": "As he grows closer to his animal spirit, the primeval becomes quicker in his humanoid form. At 8th level, his base land speed improves by 10 feet. This benefit does not apply if the primeval is wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.",
      "primeval shapechanger (su)": "The primeval unites with his animal spirit at 10th level. His type changes to magical beast (shapechanger), which means that he is no longer subject to spells that affect humanoids. In addition, he gains damage reduction 10/magic in any form. His natural attacks (but not weapon attacks) overcome damage reduction as if they were magic weapons."

      "psibond (su)": "As a member of this class, you know how to create a mental link between yourself and a subject. You must be psionically focused to forge the psibond, but afterward you can expend your focus as needed to use other abilities. Establishing a psibond requires a standard action, and an unwilling subject is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + your psibond agent level + your Cha modifier) to resist. Once established, a psibond lasts as long as you concentrate, up to a maximum of 1 minute per class level. The maximum range at which a psibond can be established is 100 feet, but once in place it persists even if the subject moves out of this range (the psibond is suppressed, but not broken, while the subject is on a different plane). A psibond grants you various options for gathering information or controlling the subject, based on your class level.",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "Beginning at 3rd level, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. See the rogue class feature, PH 50. The extra damage dealt increases to 2d6 at 6th level and to 3d6 at 9th level. If you get a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack.",
      "lingering psibond (su)": "When you attain 5th level, your psibond becomes more powerful. Your psibond remains in place for 1 round after you cease concentrating. If you resume concentration in the next round, you retain the psibond&#39;s effect as if you had never stopped concentrating.",
      "double psibond (su)": "At 7th level, you learn the secret of maintaining two psibonds simultaneously. Each psibond must be established separately against a different subject, but your concentration maintains both links equally well. Using any special abilities through the links must be done separately (for example, establishing a forced sense link requires a separate swift action for each subject)."

Traditionally, this mind-affecting ability is used when a formation of soldiers is about to charge.",

The knight makes an inspirational speech, bolstering her allies against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the knight speak. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the knight speak and for 5 rounds thereafter. While speaking, the knight can fight but cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Affected allies receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls.

The effect is negated immediately if the knight uses a fullround action to move away from the challenged opponent.",

      "weapon and armor proficiency": "A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).",
      "favored enemy (ex)": "At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table 3&#8212;14: Ranger Favored Enemies. Due to his extensive study on his chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such creatures, the ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.",
      "track": "A ranger gains Track (see page 101) as a bonus feat.",
      "wild empathy (ex)": "A ranger can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or a monitor lizard). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person (see page 72). The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.",
      "combat style (ex)": "At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character&#39;s class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way. If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.",
      "endurance": "A ranger gains Endurance (see page 93) as a bonus feat at 3rd level.",
      "animal companion (ex)": "At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the DM&#39;s campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the DM may add the following creatures to the ranger&#39;s list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind. (For instance, an aquatic creature can&#39;t adventure with a ranger on land and shouldn&#39;t be selected by a nonaquatic character without extenuating circumstances). In most cases, the animal companion functions as a mount, sentry, scout, or hunting animal, rather than as a protector.",
      "spells": "Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells (the same type of spells available to the cleric, druid, and paladin), which are drawn from the ranger spell list (page 191). A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).",
      "improved combat style (ex)</strong>: at 6th level, a ranger&#39;s aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. if he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the manyshot feat (page 97), even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p><p>if the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the improved two-weapon fighting feat (page 96), even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.</p><p>as before, the benefits of the ranger&#39;s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. he loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.</p><p><strong>woodland stride (ex)": "Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment.",
      "swift tracker (ex)": "Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal &#8212;5 penalty. He takes only a &#8212;10 penalty (instead of the normal &#8212;20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.",
      "evasion (ex)": "At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save (such as a red dragon&#39;s fiery breath or a fireball), he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger (such as one who is unconscious or paralysed) does not gain the benefit of evasion.",
      "combat style mastery (ex)": "At 11th level, a ranger&#39;s aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise Shot feat (page 96), even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.",
      "camouflage (ex)": "A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn&#39;t grant cover or concealment.",
      "hide in plain sight (ex)": "While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed."

      "pain touch (su)": "Erythnul teaches that life is pain, and so is the touch of a ravager. A ravager can make an unarmed touch attack that deals 1d8 points of damage + 1 point per ravager level. Weapon attacks also transmit the pain of Erythnul, but only at the rate of 1d4 extra points of damage + 1 point per ravager level. The ravager can make one additional pain touch attack for every three levels beyond 1st.",
      "aura of fear (su)": "Enemies within 10 feet of a ravager of 2nd level or higher take a &#8212;2 morale penalty on all saving throws for as long as they remain within range. This ability is usable a number of times per day as given on the table. Each use lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the ravagers Charisma modifier. The range of this aura increases at 5th level to 20 feet, and then again at 8th level to 30 feet.",
      "cruelest cut (ex)": "When a ravager reaches 3rd level, his familiarity with pain and fear grant him a cruel precision with his melee attacks. The character must declare he is making a cruelest cut attempt before he makes a melee attack (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). If he strikes successfully, he deals ld4 points of Constitution damage to the target, in addition to any other damage the attack may cause. A ravager can use cruelest cut once per day for every three levels he has attained, but may only make one cruelest cut attempt per round.",
      "<em>visage of terror</em> (sp)": "A 10th-level ravager has plumbed the true depths of horror and hopelessness. Once per day, he can trigger a spell-like ability similar to the arcane spell <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/phantasmal-killer--2691/\"><em>phantasmal killer</em></a> (save DC 10 + the ravager&#39;s class level + the ravager&#39;s Cha bonus) as a standard action. To the foe the ravager selects, he seems to take on the visage of what the target fears most. In all other respects, this ability functions as the spell described in the Player&#39;s Handbook."

      "spells per day/spells known</strong>: when a new rimefire witch level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spell-casting class she belonged to before adding the prestige class. she does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. if a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a rimefire witch, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day and spells known.</p><p><strong>rimefire bond (su)</strong>: a rimefire witch becomes bonded on a deeply spiritual level with the rimefire eidolon that selected her as its guardian. both the witch and the eidolon are constantly aware of the other&#39;s location and condition, as if both were under the effects of a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/status--2517/\"><em>status</em></a> spell. this is a permanent effect that cannot be dispelled or destroyed. the bond also shores up the mind and will to live of the witch and her eidolon; both gain a +2 morale bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting and death effects while the other is alive. a rimefire bond is powerful enough that it even extends across planes. if a rimefire witch or her eidolon is killed, this bond is broken. a surviving rimefire witch loses all her supernatural and spell-like abilities granted by this class (but not her spellcasting ability) until she restores the slain eidolon to life and returns it to its iceberg. a surviving eidolon does not lose any of its abilities, and typically waits for a year before sending out a call for a new guardian. if the slain member of the bond is brought back to life within a year of death, the rimefire bond instantly reforges itself despite any physical distance between the two. if more than a year has passed, the rimefire witch does not regain her powers but within a week she is contacted in her dreams by a new rimefire eidolon; once she travels to its iceberg and accepts its bond of rimefire she immediately regains her lost powers.</p><p><strong>detect minion of iborighu (sp)</strong>: a rimefire witch possesses the spell-like ability to detect minions of iborighu at will. this spell-like ability functions like <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/detect-evil--2486/\"><em>detect evil</em></a> , except that it detects the presence or absence of devotion to iborighu in a living creature&#39;s aura and soul. undetectable alignment can block this ability, as can certain magic items that have similar effects, such as the mantle of hidden faith.</p><p><strong>rimefire bolt (su)": "At 3rd level, a rimefire witch&#39;s bond with her eidolon becomes powerful enough that she can summon and direct a bolt of rimefire, as long as she is currently in the boundaries of a frostfell. Summoning and directing a rimefire bolt is a standard action. Rimefire bolts have a range of 30 feet and attack as ranged touch attacks, dealing damage equal to 1d6 + the witch&#39;s Charisma modifier. Half this damage is cold damage and half is fire damage; for more information on rimefire, see page 17. At 6th level, a rimefire witch deals cold damage equal to 2d6 + her Charisma modifier with her rimefire bolt. At 9th level, a rimefire witch deals cold damage equal to 3d6 + her Charisma modifier with her rimefire bolt.",

She can use this ability once per day, and it always recalls her to the chamber of her bonded rimefire eidolon.",

      "rimefire apotheosis (su)": "Upon achieving 10th level, a rimefire witch undergoes a dramatic transformation as the bond with her eidolon physically changes her into a fey creature. Her type immediately changes to fey, and she can no longer be affected by effects that target her old type; she does become susceptible to attacks and effects that harm or aid fey. She gains low-light vision, damage reduction 5/cold iron, and a +2 racial bonus to her Charisma score as her skin and hair become light blue or white in color. Once she undergoes rimefire apotheosis, the death of her bonded eidolon does not cause the loss of her supernatural or spellcasting abilities."

Whenever someone in a position of authority has heard of the ronin&#39;s past (usually through a DC 10 <a href=\"/skills/gather-information/\">Gather Information</a> or <a href=\"/skills/knowledge-nobility-and-royalty/\">Knowledge (nobility and royalty)</a> check), that person&#39;s attitude starts one category worse than usual, and the ronin takes a &#8212;4 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks involving that person. The infamy penalty applies only if the authority figure knows the ronin&#39;s identity, so some ronin adopt pseudonyms or secret identities.",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "If a ronin can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for an extra 1d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by 1d6 points every third level (+2d6 at 4th level, +3d6 at 7th level, +4d6 at 10th level). For complete details on the sneak attack ability, see the description of the <a href=\"/classes/dark-hunter/\">dark hunter</a> earlier in this chapter.",
      "banzai charge (ex)": "The ronin has cast away the code of bushido and at least a measure of his own honor, but his heart still remembers the thrill of bravery. When a ronin of 2nd level or higher charges into battle, he can accept a variable penalty to his Armor Class and take an equivalent bonus on the damage roll. The normal &#8212;2 AC penalty for charging still applies and counts toward the bonus, but the ronin cannot accept a penalty smaller than &#8212;2 or larger than his base attack bonus. For example, a 2nd-level ronin making a banzai charge could take a &#8212;8 penalty to AC in exchange for a +8 bonus on the damage roll.",

When unencumbered and wearing light or no armor, a sacred fist gains a +1 bonus to his AC. This bonus increases to +2 at 5th level and to +3 at 10th. This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when the sacred fist is flat-footed. He loses the bonus when he is immobilized or helpless, when he wears any armor heavier than light armor, when he carries a shield, or when he carries a medium or heavy load.",
      "spells per day/spells known": "When a new sacred fist level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in whatever divine spellcasting class he possessed before he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, wild shape ability, and so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of sacred fist to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day accordingly.",
      "unarmed damage (ex)": "A sacred fist&#39;s class levels stack with his monk levels (if any) for the purpose of determining his unarmed damage. If a sacred fist doesn&#39;t have monk levels prior to becoming a sacred fist, treat him as a monk of the same class level as his sacred fist class level for determining his unarmed damage.",
      "fast movement (ex)": "At 3rd level, a sacred fist gains an enhancement bonus to his speed. A sacred fist in medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.",
      "sacred flames (su)": "At 4th level, a sacred fist may use a standard action to invoke sacred flames around his hands and feet. These flames add to the sacred fist&#39;s unarmed damage. The additional damage is equal to the sacred fist&#39;s class level plus his Wisdom modifier (if any). Half the damage is fire damage (round up), and the rest is sacred energy and thus not subject to effects that reduce fire damage. The sacred flames last 1 minute and can be invoked once per day. At 8th level, a sacred fist can invoke sacred flames twice per day.",
      "blindsense (su)": "A 6th-level sacred fist gains sensitivity to vibrations, scent, and noise, granting him blindsense out to 10 feet.",
      "inner armor (ex)": "At 10th level, a sacred fist&#39;s inner tranquility protects him from external threats. He may invoke a +4 sacred bonus to AC, a +4 sacred bonus on all saves, and spell resistance 25 for a number of rounds equal to his Wisdom modifier. He may use inner armor once per day.",
      "code of conduct": "A member of a sacred fist order refuses to use any weapon. A sacred fist who knowingly carries or uses a weapon loses all class spells and features and advances no farther as a sacred fist until he atones for his action (see the <em>atonement</em> spell, page 201 of the Player&#39;s Handbook)."

Many samurai receive an heirloom set of these two blades, known as the daisho. Because a samurai is trained in their use, he gains <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/exotic-weapon-proficiency--985/\">Exotic Weapon Proficiency (bastard sword)</a> as a bonus feat.",
      "two swords as one (ex)": "At 2nd level, a samurai has learned to wield the katana and wakizashi together. He is treated as having the <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/two-weapon-fighting--2998/\">Two-Weapon Fighting</a> feat when wielding a katana and wakizashi, even if he does not meet the prerequisites for that feat.",
      "kiai smite (ex)": "Once per day, a samurai of 3rd level or higher can give a great cry during combat that invigorates him. When a samurai shouts (a free action), his next attack gains a bonus on the attack roll and the damage roll equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum +1). As a samurai gains levels, he can make a kiai smite more often.",

He is treated as having the <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/quick-draw--2317/\">Quick Draw</a> feat, but only when he draws his katana or wakizashi.",

He gains a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks and can demoralize an opponent (as described in the <a href=\"/skills/intimidate/\">Intimidate</a> skill description, page 76 of the Player&#39;s Handbook).",

      "improved two swords as one (ex)": "At 11th level, a samurai&#39;s prowess with the katana and wakizashi improves. He is treated as having the <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/improved-two-weapon-fighting--1593/\">Improved Two-Weapon Fighting</a> feat when wielding a katana and wakizashi, even if he does not meet the prerequisites for the feat.",

When the samurai draws his blade, opponents within 30 feet must succeed on a Will save (DC 20 + samurai&#39;s Cha modifier) or become panicked for 4d6 rounds (if they have 4 or fewer Hit Dice) or shaken for 4d6 rounds (if they have from 5 to 19 Hit Dice). Creatures with 20 or more Hit Dice are not affected. Any foe that successfully resists the effect cannot be affected again by the same samurai&#39;s frightful presence for 24 hours."

You do not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a sand shaper, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.",

When casting arcane spells in any sort of waste terrain, your caster level is considered to be one level higher than your actual caster level. Even in nonwaste environments, as long as you carry 15 or more pounds of sand as part of your equipment, you gain the benefit of this class feature. ",

If you were a caster who previously prepared spells (such as a wizard), you can prepare these spells like any other spell to which you have access.

Three times per day, when you cast an arcane spell in any sort of waste terrain, you can empower, enlarge, extend, silence, or still your spell, as the appropriate metamagic feats. These options have the same general effect as the metamagic feats of the same name, except that they do not use up higher-level spell slots, and even if you prepare spells, you can decide to alter them with this ability as you cast a spell.

Five times per day, when you cast spells in any sort of waste terrain, you can choose to maximize or widen your spell. Uses of this ability and of improved dust magic (see above) come from the same pool, so you can use both abilities a total of five times per day. For example, you could empower four times per day and maximize once, or widen three times and enlarge two times. These options have the same general effect as the metamagic feats of the same name, except that they do not use up higher-level spell slots, and even if you prepare spells, you can decide to alter them with this ability as you cast a spell.

      "desert shroud (ex)": "At 10th level, you gain the ability to come back to life under certain consitions. If the remains of your deceased body lie in the soil of the waste (generally desert sand, dust, or gravel) for 10 minutes, you are restored to life as though a resurrection spell had been cast upon you, provided you have not been dead for more than one hundred years. The soil must be deep enough, and occupy a large enough area, to cover your entire body (based on your size when the effect is complete)."

      "academic lore": "The savant studies a wide variety of disciplines, from the physiology and lore of plants to the genealogy of ancient noble lines. The savant may make a special academic lore check with a bonus equal to his savant level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about a particular situation, person, item, historical event, or other subject. If the savant fails this check, he must gain at least one level in this class before attempting to use this ability to answer the specific question again. ",

If, for example, a savant sees an approaching ogre, he knows how to deliver a swift warning that alerts his allies before the ogre is upon them. If he and his friends must slip into a blackguard&#39;s fortress, his intense study of stealth and reconnaissance allows him to mask the clanks of his paladin ally&#39;s armor. At 1st level and again at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter (8th, 12th, and so on), the savant selects a skill from the following list in which he has at least 1 rank: Balance, Climb, Disguise, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Ride, Spot, and Swim.",

      "talent lore": "The savant gains a bonus feat at 2nd level and every five levels thereafter. His intense studies and wide range of training grant him access to specialized abilities and talents.",
      "sneak attack": "Beginning at 3rd level, if a savant can catch an opponent unable to defend itself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage.",
      "arcane lore": "Savants study magic with the same curiosity and intellectual rigor they use to approach other topics. Through an understanding of the basic theories of magic, the savant learns to cast a limited number of arcane spells.",
      "divine lore": "At 10th level, the savant&#39;s broad range of study and research allows him to unlock the secrets of divine magic. He learns to manipulate deific energy and use it to cast spells much like a cleric."

The scaled horror has the option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use its natural weapons or unarmed attack to hold the opponent. Each successful grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals damage given for the attack that established the hold.",

To cast a spell, the scaled horror must have a Wisdom score of at least 10 + the spell&#39;s level, so a scaled horror with a Wisdom of 10 or lower cannot cast these spells. Scaled horror bonus spells are based on Wisdom, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + the scaled horror&#39;s Wisdom bonus. When the scaled horror gets 0 spells of a given level, such as 0 1st-level spells at 1st level, the scaled horror gets only bonus spells. A scaled horror without a bonus spell for that level cannot yet cast a spell of that level. A scaled horror pre- pares and casts spells just as a ranger does (though the scaled horror&#39;s caster level is the same as its class level).",

Additionally, your armor has been blessed by a cleric of Tem-Et-Nu, which means the armor check penalty for your armor is not doubled for the purposes of Swim checks. If you ever lose your armor, or if you want a new suit blessed, a cleric of Tem-Et-Nu can perform the ceremony to bless your armor at any temple devoted to your patron deity. The blessing is free of charge for scions.",
      "river mastery (ex)": "As a member of this class, you gain a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against river-dwelling aquatic creatures. ",
      "spellcasting": "At each even-numbered level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a scion of Tem-Et-Nu, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known. ",
      "river&#39;s vigor (su)": "Beginning at 2nd level, you can emulate the vigor and unstoppable power of the river during a spring flood, gaining 5 temporary hit points per scion class level for 1 minute per scion class level once per day. From 6th level on, you can use river&#39;s vigor two times per day (the temporary hit points gained with each use of this ability do not stack). ",
      "river walk (sp)": "At 3rd level and higher, you can tread on river water as though you were affected by a <em>water walk</em> spell. You can use this ability once per day for every three scion of Tem-Et-Nu levels. Your caster level for this ability is equal to your class level. ",
      "the river&#39;s life is mine (su)": "At 3rd level and higher, you gain fast healing 5 whenever you begin your turn in or adjacent to a square containing a river. ",
      "smite evil (su)": "Beginning at 4th level, once per day you can attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. You add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your attack roll and deal an extra 1 point of damage per class level. If you accidentally smite a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for the day. You must declare the use of the smite before making the attack roll. Starting at 8th level, you can smite twice per day. If you have levels in a class that grant a smite evil ability (such as paladin), you gain extra uses of that ability, and the levels of that class stack with your scion of Tem-Et-Nu class levels to determine the power of your smite evil ability. ",
      "divine power (sp)": "At 5th level, you gain the benefit of divine power, as the spell, once per day. Your caster level is equal to your class level. If you activate this ability while submerged up to your waist (or deeper) in a river, the amount of time you benefit from the ability does not count toward the duration of the effect until you move out of water of this depth. Once the duration begins to count down, however, it does not stop even if you proceed to immerse yourself in waist-deep water. At 10th level, you can use this ability twice per day. ",
      "control water (sp)": "Beginning at 6th level, you can use control water, as the spell, three times per day. Your caster level is equal to your class level. ",
      "restoring immersion (sp)": "When you attain 7th level, you become able to draw upon the power of Tem-Et-Nu once per day to benefit from a restoration effect if you immerse yourself completely in water for a short time. Restoring negative levels requires that you be immersed for 1 minute per negative level. Curing ability score damage requires 5 rounds per point, and restoring drained ability score points requires 1 minute per point. You can receive more than one benefit during each period of immersion you undergo. For example, you could restore three negative levels and four drained ability points by remaining immersed for 7 consecutive minutes.Your caster level for this ability is equal to your class level. ",
      "divert river (sp)": "At 9th level, you become capable of changing the course of a river for a short time. With slow-moving rivers, this is the equivalent of casting both versions of control water simultaneously: lower water downstream of your location, and raise water aimed at where you divert the river. Water overflows the river&#39;s bank where you specify, rather than following the natural contours of the river. With fastmoving rivers, the effect is more dramatic: The river downstream is affected as though the lower water version of control water had been cast, and a flashflood effect, as the spell (see page 114), originates at the point on the river that you specify. Regardless of the speed of the river, the effect lasts for 2 hours unless you choose to end it sooner. ",

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, wild shape ability, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of seeker of the Misty Isle to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day accordingly. If a character had more than one spellcasting class in which she could cast 2nd-level divine spells before she became a seeker of the Misty Isle, the player must decide which class to assign each level of seeker of the Misty Isle for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.",

She gains a +5 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks. Furthermore, she can attempt to spot or hear something she failed to notice previously once per round per skill as a free action (such attempts are ordinarily move actions).",
      "surefooted (ex)": "As a side effect of the seeker of the Misty Isle&#39;s keen senses, she is always searching the terrain around her. Accordingly, she has a preternatural sense of minute details in the landscape she can use to her advantage. She can ignore DC modifiers on Balance, Move Silently, and Tumble checks derived from the surface or terrain.",

      "spells": "A sha&#39;ir&#39;s spells must be retrieved from the elemental planes by his familiar, an outsider called a gen. Once retrieved, a spell remains set in the sha&#39;ir&#39;s memory, like a wizard&#39;s prepared spell, until cast or until a number of hours pass equal to the sha&#39;ir&#39;s class level. A sha&#39;ir is capable of extraordinarily versatile spellcasting because he can use arcane spells as well as a limited selection of divine spells. A sha&#39;ir&#39;s familiar can retrieve any spell on the sorcerer/ wizard spell list, plus any spell from the Air, Chaos, Earth, Fire, Knowledge, Law, Luck, Sun, and Water domain spell lists. Even though the sha&#39;ir has access to certain domain spells, he gains no other benefit of the cleric class, including the granted powers of those domains.",
      "metamagic feats": "A sha&#39;ir may use metamagic feats he possesses to modify the spells his gen fetches. The gen simply fetches the spell with the metamagic feats applied. Unlike the sorcerer, the sha&#39;ir does not need to take a full-round action to cast such spells.",
      "bonus languages": "A sha&#39;ir may substitute Aquan, Auran, Ignan, or Terran for any of the bonus languages available to his race. Sha&#39;irs are expected to have a great deal of contact with elemental entities, and apprentice sha&#39;irs often study the languages that such creatures speak.",
      "summon gen familiar": "A sha&#39;ir must obtain a gen familiar (see Gen Familiars) at 1st level. A gen familiar is an intelligent outsider that resembles a small elemental. The creature serves as a companion and servant to the sha&#39;ir. The sha&#39;ir may choose the elemental type of the gen he summons, and its alignment matches his own. The summoning takes 12 hours and consumes raw materials that cost 100 gp.",
      "recognize genie works": "At 3rd level, a sha&#39;ir can recognize the craftsmanship of any item or magical effect created by geniekind. To use this ability, the sha&#39;ir must make a successful DC 20 Knowledge (the planes) check. The sha&#39;ir receives a bonus on this check equal to his sha&#39;ir level.",
      "elemental protection": "At 5th level, a sha&#39;ir gains resistance to acid 2, cold 2, electricity 2, and fire 2. He also gains damage reduction 2/&#8212; against attacks made by any creature with the air, earth, fire, or water subtype. The resistance increases to 4 against the energy type to which his gen is immune (see below), and the damage reduction increases to 4/&#8212; against attacks made by creatures of his gen&#39;s elemental subtype. He also gains a +2 bonus on all saves against acid-, cold-, electricity-, and fire-based attacks, and this bonus increases to +4 against attacks that deal the energy damage to which his gen is immune.",
      "call janni (sp)": "A 7th-level or higher sha&#39;ir may call a janni to aid him once per day. This functions as the lesser planar ally spell except that the Sha&#39;ir can only call a janni. The sha&#39;ir must pay the spell&#39;s XP cost and bargain with the janni as normal. Caster level is equal to the sha&#39;ir&#39;s class level.",
      "elemental travel (sp)": "A gen can plane shift at will to any of the Elemental Planes or from any elemental plane to the Material Plane. This ability transports the gen only. It is otherwise identical to the plane shift spell (caster level 13th).",
      "call genie (sp)": "An 11th-level or higher sha&#39;ir may call any type of genie to aid him once per day. This functions as the planar ally spell except that the Sha&#39;ir can only call one dao (see the Manual of the Planes), djinni, efreeti, or marid (see the Manual of the Planes), or two jann. The sha&#39;ir must pay the spell&#39;s XP cost and bargain with the genie or jann as normal. Caster level is equal to the sha&#39;ir&#39;s class level.",
      "craft genie prison (ex)": "At 13th level, a sha&#39;ir gains the benefit ofthe Craft Wondrous Item feat, except that he can use it only to create genie prisons. A genie prison is created in die same way as an iron flask and functions identically to that device, except that it can hold only geniekind.",
      "combat</strong><br />all gens have certain traits in common. they prefer to avoid combat, a task that is easy for them since they can travel to the elemental planes at will and survive equally well in any of them.</p><p><strong>elemental endurance (ex)": "A gen can survive on the elemental planes like a native. On the Elemental Plane o f Fire, a gen is immune to fire damage. On the Elemental Plane of Water, a gen can breathe water and has a swim speed equal to its fly speed (gaining the normal +8 racial bonus on Swim checks). On the Elemental Plane of Earth, a gen has a burrow speed equal to its land speed, leaving no tunnel or sign of its passage as though it has the earth glide ability o f a xorn (see the Monster Manual).",

Your bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + your Intelligence bonus. When you get 0 spells per day, you gain only the bonus spells you would be entitled to based on your intelligence score for that spell level. You cast spells just as a sorcerer does.",
      "trap sense (ex)": "Your expertise with dungeons gives you an intuitive sense that alerts you to danger from traps, providing you with a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by 1 every other level, up to +5 at 9th level. Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple sources stack.",
      "tricks of the trade (ex)": "The experiences and dangers that you have encountered in your travels begin to coalesce into a practical body of knowledge when you enter the shade hunter class. This knowledge grants you a bonus equal to your class level that can be used each day to augment ability checks, skill checks, or attack rolls. The points of bonus do not need to be applied to the same roll, and you can divide them up however you like throughout the day. You must decide whether or not to use a bonus, and if so how large the bonus will be, before you roll the die.",
      "low-light vision (ex)": "At 2nd level, you gain low-light vision. If you already have low-light vision, its effective distance is doubled, so you can now see four times as far as a human in conditions of low light.",
      "sense ancient magic (su)": "Starting at 2nd level, you can detect the magical aura radiated by items of Netherese creation. This ability functions like <em>detect magic</em>, except that it is always active unless you consciously suppress it, and it can only detect the auras of magic items that have been in the same location for at least one hundred years.",
      "expert packer": "Starting at 3rd level, you have learned how to get every last bit of utility out of your backpack, belt, and bandoleer. Reduce the weight of your gear by 10% for purposes of figuring your load.",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "At 4th level and higher, you deal extra damage when you catch a foe flat-footed or flank a foe, as the rogue class feature described on page 50 of the Player&#39;s Handbook. Sneak-attack dice attained from multiple sources stack.",
      "tools of the trade": "By 4th level, you have picked up so many knickknacks and strange tools on your travels that you&#39;ve lost track of everything you own. Once per day, you can &quot;find&quot; any mundane piece of equipment (other than weapons or armor) worth up to 10 gp per class level somewhere on your person, having forgotten completely about it. When you do so, you must subtract an equivalent amount of gold (or other treasure &#8211; gems, jewelry, art, etc.) from your savings. If you do not have enough gold to cover the cost of the item you want, you might not find the item with this ability.",
      "darkvision (ex)": "At 5th level, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its effective distance extends by an additional 60 feet instead.",
      "special ability (ex)": "At 6th level, you can choose one of the following rogue special abilities: defensive roll, improved evasion, or skill mastery (see Player&#39;s Handbook page 51).",
      "locate ancient magic (su)": "When you reach 7th level, your ability to sense the lost magic of Netheril has grown stronger. You can now locate any magic items that have been in the same location for at least one hundred years as if you had cast a <em>locate object</em> spell and were familiar with the items in question. Activating this ability is a standard action, and you can locate multiple auras by concentrating for continuous rounds.",
      "improved favored enemy (ex)": "Starting at 8th level, your favored enemy bonuses against shades increase by 2. No other favored enemy bonuses can be increased with this ability.",
      "blindsight (ex)": "At 10th level your ability to function in the deepest, darkest dungeons grants you the ability to sense your surroundings using every available sensory input. You gain blindsight out to 30 feet."

A shadow scout may select another human clan as his favored enemy. Due to his extensive study of his foes and training in the proper techniques for combating them, the scout gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Wilderness Lore checks when using these skills against this type of creature. Likewise, he gets the same bonus on weapon damage rolls against creatures of this type. The shadow scout also gets the damage bonus with ranged weapons, but only against targets within 30 feet. The bonus doesn&#39;t apply to damage against creatures that are immune to critical hits. At 4th level and at every three levels thereafter (4th, 7th, and 10th level), the bonus goes up by +1.

The shadow scout can only use evasion if he is wearing light armor or no armor.",
      "<em>detect</em> enemy (sp)": "At 3rd level, a shadow scout gains the ability to detect the presence of his favored enemy. The ability is similar to the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/detect-evil--2486/\"><em>detect evil</em></a> spell in range, area, and duration. In the first round of concentration, the shadow scout can ascertain the presence or absence of his favored enemy within the area. In the second round, the shadow scout can determine the number of creatures in the area and the power of the strongest one (as per the <em>detect evil</em> spell). In the third round, the shadow scout can determine the strength and location of each creature. If the shadow scout has more than one favored enemy, he can detect any of them, and on the second round he can determine what kind of creature is in the area.",
      "memory": "At 6th level, a shadow scout&#39;s memory is greatly enhanced. He can hold in his mind an image he has seen or up to 1 minute of speech, and can describe the details or repeat the words (even if he does not speak the language) as if he were still present. The shadow scout can only hold one image or sound in his mind at a time.",
      "freeze (su)": "By keeping completely still while using the Hide skill, a shadow scout of 8th level or higher can vanish into his surroundings. He gains a +15 bonus on his Hide check. The shadow scout can use this ability three times per day.",
      "smite enemy (su)": "A 9th-level shadow scout gains the ability to smite his favored enemy once per day. He adds his Intelligence modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per level. This damage bonus stacks with his favored enemy bonus. If the shadow scout has more than one favored enemy, he can smite any of them, but can still use the ability only once per day."

      "absolute conviction (ex)": "Should a shadowbane inquisitor&#39;s alignment ever change from lawful good for any reason, he may not take additional levels in this prestige class, but he does not lose any class abilities from levels already attained.",
      "pierce shadows (su)": "A shadowbane inquisitor can spend one of his daily uses of his turn undead ability to shed a holy radiance. This light brightly illuminates an area in a radius of 20 feet plus 5 feet per class level of the inquisitor. The light is centered on the inquisitor and sheds no shadowy illumination beyond its border. This radiance lasts for 10 minutes per inquisitor class level.",
      "sacred stealth (su)": "Starting at 2nd level, a shadowbane inquisitor can channel some of his divine spell power to become stealthier. To do this, he must lose a prepared divine spell from memory (or give up a potential spell slot for the day if he casts spells as a sorcerer). He gains a +4 sacred bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks for a number of minutes equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) plus the level of spell given up in this manner.",
      "smite (su)": "Once per day, a shadowbane inquisitor of 2nd level or higher can attempt to smite a creature that he judges to be corrupt with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per inquisitor class level. Unlike with a paladin&#39;s smite evil ability, an inquisitor relies only on his own judgment when determining what creatures to use this ability against. How an inquisitor uses this ability exemplifies his outlook on the world. The more suspicious and uncompromising an inquisitor is, the more likely he is to feel that a creature should be struck down.",
      "improved sunder": "At 3rd level, a shadowbane becomes accomplished at shattering the weapons of his foes and tainted magic items. He gains the Improved Sunder feat as a bonus feat.",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "Beginning at 4th level, a shadowbane inquisitor deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 7th level and 3d6 points at 10th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player&#39;s Handbook. If a shadowbane inquisitor gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.",
      "merciless purity (su)": "Beginning at 5th level, a shadowbane inquisitor benefits when his enemies perish. Upon the death of a creature that the inquisitor has designated as corrupt, he gains a +1 sacred bonus on his Fortitude and Reflex saves for the next 24 hours. An inquisitor designates a creature as corrupt in his eyes by using his smite ability (see above) as part of a melee attack against the creature. The inquisitor need not kill the creature himself. An inquisitor can benefit from this ability only once per day; subsequent deaths of creatures that he has designated as corrupt grant no special benefit.",
      "righteous fervor (su)": "When an inquisitor of 8th level or higher designates a creature as corrupt, he gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack and damage rolls against that creature for the rest of the encounter. The inquisitor designates a creature as corrupt by using his smite ability (see above) as part of a melee attack against the creature. This bonus does not apply to the smite attempt itself, only to subsequent attacks against the same creature made in that encounter.",
      "burning light (su)": "At 9th level and higher, an inquisitor can spend one of his daily uses of his turn undead ability to deal damage to creatures around him. To do this, he must already have his pierce shadows ability active. All creatures within the illuminated area (except for the inquisitor) take 4d6 points of damage. This damage results directly from divine power and is not subject to being reduced by energy resistance. Using this ability requires a standard action."

      "fundamentals of shadow (su)": "As a shadowcaster, you must master certain basic powers before proceeding to deeper secrets of shadow. These powers, known as fundamentals, function as supernatural abilities usable three time per day. You begin play with three fundamentals and gain an additional fundamental at 4th level and every four additional levels beyond 4th. At 14th level, you can use your fundamentals an unlimited number of times per day. You can, when gaining a new level, choose a new fundamental in place of another mystery. When choosing a fundamental, you can &quot;relearn&quot; an already known fundamental, thus gaining another set of uses of that fundamental per day. The save DC of any fundamental is equal to 10 + your Cha modifier.",
      "mysteries and paths": "You do not cast spells as other classes do, but instead invoke mystical secrets called mysteries. You know one mystery at 1st level and gain one additional mystery every class level. Up to 6th level, you can learn only apprentice mysteries. At 7th level, you gain access to initiate mysteries, and at 13th level you become able to use master mysteries. You can choose your new mystery from any category you have access to (including fundamentals). For instance, at 8th level, you could select either a fundamental, an apprentice mystery, or an initiate mystery.",
      "bonus feats": "Beginning at 2nd level, you gain bonus feats equal to half the total number of paths you have access to, rounded down. For instance, most shadowcasters know the first mystery of two different paths at 2nd level, so they gain one bonus feat. If you learn the first mystery of a third path at 3rd level, you still have only one bonus feat, but if you learn the first mystery of yet another path at 4th level, you know four paths, and therefore gain a second bonus feat. Thus, you have a choice: fully mastery fewer paths and gain access to more high-level mysteries, or branch out into more paths and gain more feats but fewer high-level mysteries. You do not gain a new bonus feat for repeating a path you already know, and fundamentals do not apply for the purpose of bonus feats. ",
      "umbral sight(su)": "when you reach 3rd level, your vision extends slightly into the Plane of Shadow. You gain darkvision out to 30 feet. If you already have darkvision, or gain it from another source, the effective distance of that vision is increased by 30 feet. At 11th level, you become able to see perfectly in complete darkness, even magical darkness, out to 60 feet.",
      "sustaining shadow(ex)": "When you reach 5th level, your bond to the Plane of Shadow allows you to absorb dark energies, mitigating certain biological needs. You need eat only a single meal per week to maintain health. At 10th level, you only need 1 hour of sleep per night (but you must still rest for 8 hours to regain your mysteries for the next day). At 1th level, you can immunity to nonmagical diseases and poisons. Finally, at 20th level, you no longer need to breathe, and need never eat or sleep."

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the new level of shaper of form to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. For example, if an 8th-level cleric gains a level in shaper of form, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 9th level in cleric but uses the other shaper of form aspects of level progression such as attack bonus and save bonus. If she next gains a level of cleric, making her a 9th-level cleric/1st-level shaper of form, she gains spells as if she had risen to become a loth-level cleric.",

Similar items have the same or nearly the same shape and weight within 50% of each other. Similar items must also share a material in their construction that constitutes at least half of their form. For example, the shaper of form can transform a scimitar into a longsword, since both are swords that weight the same. She cannot change a dagger into a short sword, for example, because a short sword weighs twice as much as a dagger. The shaper of form could also change a set of leather armor into a set of studded leather but not a chain shirt (because the chain shirt is made of steel and not leather). Sometimes, overall improvements can be made, but the value of the item cannot increase by more than double its original worth. This change is permanent and cannot be dispelled or otherwise removed by any means short of a wish or miracle.",
      "modify self (ex)": "At 1st level and every three levels thereafter (at 4th, 7th, and 10th level), the shaper of form can gain one effect from the following list, achieved through applying shaping magic to her own body. The effect is permanent. The shaper of form can choose the same ability more than once&#8212;the effects of each ability stack with themselves. For example, a shaper of form who takes the resilience ability three times has a permanent +3 natural armor bonus to her Armor Class. These effects cannot be removed by any means short of a wish or miracle, and each use of one of those spells removes only a single effect of this ability (thus, multiple wishes must be used to eliminate multiple benefits).",

The change is permanent, and an object can receive the benefit of this ability only once. This effect cannot be removed by any means short of a wish or miracle.",
      "polymorph (sp)": "At 2nd level, the shaper of form can cast polymorph once per day as a spell-like ability. At 3rd level, the shaper of form can cast polymorph twice per day.",
      "resist shaping (ex)": "At 4th level, the shaper of form gains a +2 inherent bonus on saves against transmutation magic.",
      "as above, so below (su)": "Once per day at 6th level the shaper of form can temporarily alter any non-living object of her size or smaller, changing it into another object of her size or smaller that the shaper can touch. For example, if the shaper sees an orc charging at her with a greatsword, she can transform a rock at her feet into a greatsword. The finished item can have a value no greater than 1,000 gp per level of the shaper of form. Magic qualities can be duplicated as well, as long as the shaper of form can identify them with a successful Spellcraft check. Thus, if the shaper of form can see someone else with hoots of striding and springing, she can transform her boots (or anything else she can touch) into hoots ofstriding and springing. The change lasts for 1 round per shaper of form level. This effect cannot be removed before its duration expires by any means short of a wish or miracle.",
      "polymorph any object (sp)": "At 9th level, the shaper of form can cast polymorph any object once per day as a spell- like ability.",
      "disable (sp)": "At 10th level, the shaper of form gains the ability to ruin an item once every other day. This ability allows the shaper of form to create a Mordenkainen&#39;s disjunction effect to completely remove all magical abilities from a single item or to disintegrate (as the spell) any nonmagical, nonliving object. Neither use of this ability allows a saving throw, although artifacts can only be affected as described under Mordenkainen&#39;s disjunction"

She does not, however, gain any other benefit of the spellcasting class. This essentially means that she adds half her shapeshifter levels to her other class levels, then determines spells per day and spells known accordingly. For example, if Jengu Tori, a 7th-level wu jen/1st-level shapeshifter, gains a level in shapeshifter, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 8th level in wu jen, but uses the other shapeshifter aspects of level progression such as attack bonus and save bonus.

They are forbidden to eat meat (though they may eat fish), commit murder or theft, or marry. Shintao monks are expected to avoid causing violence, though circumstances can make that impossible. Gluttony and drunkenness are vices to be avoided, and holy places must be treated with respect. Shintao monks cannot accumulate wealth or become involved in politics. A Shintao monk who violates this code of conduct or strays from a lawful good alignment cannot gain new levels as a Shintao monk but retains all monk class abilities. Assuming he remains lawful, he can continue to advance in the monk class."

They are not proficient with any type of armor, nor with shields. In their home culture, it is considered inappropriate for a shugenja to wear armor, although shugenjas serving with the military or traveling in foreign lands sometimes take the time to learn how to wear armor properly. Armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, Swim, and Tumble. Armor does not interfere with his spellcasting.",
      "spells": "A shugenja casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to clerics and druids), which are drawn from the shugenja spell list (page 144). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below).",
      "element focus": "All shugenjas have a favored element: air, earth, fire, or water. A shugenja&#39;s choice of specialized element is sometimes determined by the shugenja order in which he studies. At least half the spells a shugenja knows at each spell level must belong to his favored element, and the spell dictated by his order often belongs to that element as well. This is reflected on Table 1&#8212;4, which indicates how many spells of each level must be spells of the shugenja&#39;s favored element. At 1st level, for example, the shugenja Kitsu Mari must know at least three 0-level water spells&#8212;one water spell determined by his order and two additional water spells, plus two other 0-level spells of any element. He also knows one 1st-level water spell from his order, one additional 1st-level water spell, and one 1st-level spell of any element. Shugenjas automatically gain the benefits of the Spell Focus feat (+1 to spell DCs) for spells from their favored element, regardless of its school. "

If he previously had a similar ability (red slaad&#39;s implant ability or blue slaad&#39;s disease ability), he can now use that ability with any of his natural attacks. The affected creature must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + slaad brooder&#39;s character level + slaad brooder&#39;s Con modifier) to avoid implantation. The egg gestates for one week before hatching into a slaad that eats his way out, killing the host. Twenty-four hours before the egg fully matures, the host falls extremely ill (&#8212;10 to all ability scores). A <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/remove-disease--2428/\"><em>remove disease</em></a> spell rids a host of the pellet, as does a successful Heal check (DC 20).

This feature affects the host as indicated. Where a save is permitted, the DC is equal to 10 + slaad brooder&#39;s character level + slaad brooder&#39;s Con modifier. Roll separately for each implant attack.",
      "deep implant (ex)": "At 3rd level, a slaad brooder can implant his pellet more deeply within the host&#39;s body, adding +2 to the DC of the Fortitude save to resist implantation. In addition, repeated Heal checks after the first to remove the pellet deal 1d6 points of damage to the patient instead of the usual 1d4 points, as the healer must cut more deeply into the host&#39;s body.",
      "rapid hatching (ex)": "On reaching 4th level, a slaad brooder gains the ability to transfer some of his own vitality into the egg pellet, allowing it to mature more quickly. The egg hatches in 24 hours instead of 1 week. Six hours before it hatches, the host comes down with the severe illness, losing 10 points from each ability score.",
      "chaos focus (su)": "At 5th level, a slaad brooder&#39;s imbue pellet ability becomes more potent: The DC to halve or negate the damage from the additional feature of the pellet (burn, caustic, chill, or shock) increases by +2.",
      "multiple implant (ex)": "At 6th level, a slaad brooder can implant more than one pellet within the host&#39;s body. Each of his natural attacks that hits can implant an egg pellet.",
      "color choice (ex)": "At 7th level, a slaad brooder can choose the color of his spawn. He can produce a green slaad even if the host creature is not an arcane spellcaster. He can determine the color of each pellet&#39;s spawn if he has implanted more than one in the same host.",
      "heighten chaos (su)": "At 8th level, the DC to halve or negate the damage from the additional feature of an egg pellet increases by +2. This bonus stacks with the bonus provided by the chaos focus ability.",
      "corporeal instability (su)": "On reaching 9th level, a slaad brooder can effect a terrible transformation on the host creature. Unless she makes a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + slaad brooder&#39;s level + Slaad brooder&#39;s Con modifier), the host&#39;s shape melts into a formless mass. She cannot hold or use any item, nor can she wear clothing or armor. Her speed drops to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is lower. She can no longer cast spells or use magic items, and she cannot distinguish between friend and foe, attacking blindly (&#8212;4 penalty on attack rolls, 50% miss chance).",
      "death spawn (ex)": "At 9th level, a slaad brooder&#39;s extraordinary vitality gives his egg pellets the ability to hatch even from a host that has died (the death of a host becomes an increasingly likely event as a brooder<br />becomes more powerful). Neither <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/remove-disease--2428/\"><em>remove disease</em></a> spells nor Heal checks can destroy the pellets growing in a dead host, but destruction of the body by fire, acid, <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/disintegrate--2801/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/disintegrate--2801/\"><em>disintegrate</em></a> spells, and the like will do so.",
      "<em>dominate spawn</em> (sp)": "On reaching 10th level, the slaad brooder becomes the undisputed master of spawn. If he is present at the hatching of a red, blue, or green slaad, he can take control of the newborn<br />as with a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dominate-monster--2546/\"><em>dominate monster</em></a> spell. The effect lasts one day per slaad brooder&#39;s character level. The hatchling can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC 10 + slaad brooder&#39;s level + slaad brooder&#39;s Con modifier). "

He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), save for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a spellsword, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.",
      "ignore spell failure (ex)": "Beginning at 1st level, a spell sword&#39;s hard work and practice at merging spellcraft with weaponplay starts to pay off. As an extraordinary ability, he ignores a portion of the arcane spell failure chance associated with using armor. This reduction starts at 10%and gradually increases to 30%, as shown on the class table. A spellsword subtracts the given percentage value from his total spell failure chance, if any. For instance, a character wearing scale mail and carrying a small shield normally has a spell failure chance of 30%, but this drops to only 20% for a 1st-level spellsword.",

      "channel spell (sp)": "At 4th level, a spellsword can channel any spell he can cast into his melee weapon. Using this ability requires a move action, and the spellsword uses up the prepared spell or spell slot just as if he had cast the spell. The channeled spell affects the next target that the spell sword successfully attacks with his weapon (saving throws and spell resistance still apply). Even if the spell normally affects an area or is a ray, it affects only the target. The spell is discharged from the weapon, which can then hold an other spell. A spellsword can channel his spells into only one weapon at a time. Spells channeled into a weapon are lost if not used in 8 hours.",
      "multiple channel spell (sp)": "A 10th-level spellsword can channel two spells into his melee weapon, using a move action to channel each one. Both channeled spells affect the next target the spellsword successfully attacks with his weapon, in the order the spells were placed into the weapon. As with the channel spell class feature, saving throws and spell resistance apply normally. Each time a spellsword uses multiple channel spell, two of his five channel spell uses per day are expended."

Because the somatic components required for spellthief spells are simple, a spellthief can cast spellthief spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, a spellthief wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (see page 123 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>) if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass spellthief still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes, including those stolen from arcane casters (see the steal spell ability, below).",
      "sneak attack (ex)": "A spellthief deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 5th level, 3d6 points at 9th level, 4d6 points at 13th level, and 5d6 points at 17th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>. If a spellthief gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack.",

A spellthief who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead steal a spell, or the potential to cast a specific known spell, from his target. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell with a touch as a standard action.",
      "trapfinding (ex)": "A spellthief can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and he can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>.",

If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell effect with a touch as a standard action.",
      "steal energy resistance (su)": "Beginning at 3rd level, a spellthief can siphon off some or all of a target&#39;s resistance to an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). A spellthief who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead temporarily gain resistance 10 to an energy type to which his target is resistant or immune). If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal energy resistance with a touch as a standard action.",
      "spells": "Beginning at 4th level, a spellthief gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from a subset of the sorcerer/wizard spell list (see below).

      "steal spell-like ability (su)": "At 5th level and higher, a spellthief can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal a creature&#39;s spell-like ability. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead gain one use of one of the target&#39;s spell-like abilities. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell-like ability with a touch as a standard action.",
      "absorb spell (su)": "Beginning at 7th level, if a spellthief makes a successful save against a spell that targets him, he can attempt to absorb the spell energy for later use. This ability affects only spells that have the spellthief asa target, not effect or area spells. A spellthief can&#39;t absorb a spell of a higher spell level than he could steal with his steal spell ability (see above).",
      "arcane sight (sp)": "Beginning at 9th level, a spellthief can use <em>arcane sight</em> as a swift action (see page 137) a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1). His caster level is equal to his spellthief class level.",
      "discover spells (ex)": "A spellthief of 13th level or higher who steals a spell from a spellcaster with his steal spell ability automatically learns the names of all other spells prepared or known by the spellcaster that are of the same spell level as the stolen spell. This knowledge allows the spellthief to better choose which spells to steal on subsequent attacks.",
      "steal spell resistance (su)": "Beginning at 15th level, a spellthief can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal some or all of a creature&#39;s spell resistance. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo 3d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead reduce the target&#39;s spell resistance by 5. The spellthief also gains spell resistance equal to 5 + his class level (up to a maximum value equal to the original spell resistance of the target).

These are the weapons commonly used by the tribal societies in which spirit shamans are found.",
      "spells": "A spirit shaman casts divine spells from the druid spell list. She can cast any spell she has retrieved, much like a bard or sorcerer can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time.",
      "spirit guide": "All spirit shamans have a spirit guide, a personification of the spirit world. In some sense a spirit shaman and her guide are one being, both knowing and seeing and experiencing the same things. Unlike a familiar, a spirit guide is not a separate entity from a spirit shaman. She is the only one who can perceive or interact with her guide. It exists only inside her own mind and soul.",
      "wild empathy (ex)": "Guided by her insight into animal spirits, a spirit shaman can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (a monster of the animal type). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4: Skills in the <em>Player&#39;s Handbook</em>). The spirit shaman rolls 1d20 and adds her spirit shaman level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.",
      "chastise spirits (su)": "Beginning at 2nd level, a spirit shaman can use divine energy granted by her patrons in the spirit world to damage hostile spirits (see the What is a Spirit? sidebar). ",
      "detect spirits (sp)": "The spirit shaman&#39;s spirit guide perceives nearby spirits. At will, the spirit shaman can use detect spirits as a spell-like ability. It functions just like detect undead, except it detects creatures that are considered spirits.",
      "blessing of the spirits (sp)": "Starting at 4th level, a spirit shaman can perform a special rite to gain a special blessing. The shaman goes into a meditative state in which she travels to the spirit world. Performing the rite requires 10 minutes; the spirit shaman can only ward herself with this ability and cannot perform the rite for anyone else. The blessing functions just like <em>protection from evil</em>, except it protects against spirits and lasts until it is dismissed or dispelled. If this ability is dispelled, the spirit shaman can recreate it simply by taking 10 minutes to do so.",
      "follow the guide (su)": "At 5th level and higher, a spirit shaman&#39;s spirit guide helps her maintain control of her mind. If a spirit shaman is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw. ",
      "ghost warrior (su)": "Beginning at 6th level, a spirit shaman confers the ghost touch special ability (see Magic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions, page 223 of the <em>Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide</em>) to any weapon she holds for as long as she holds it. She also becomes resistant to the touch attacks of incorporeal creatures, and may use her normal Armor Class (not her touch AC) against any touch attack delivered by an incorporeal creature.",
      "warding of the spirits (sp)": "Starting at 7th level, a spirit shaman can perform a special rite once per day to ward herself and her companions against hostile spirits. Performing the rite requires 1 minute. The warding lasts for 10 minutes per level and otherwise functions like <em>magic circle against evil</em>, except it protects against spirits.",
      "spirit form (su)": "At 9th level and higher, a spirit shaman learns how to temporarily transform herself into a spirit. Once per day, as a standard action, she can make herself incorporeal for up to 1 minute.",
      "guide magic (su)": "Starting at 10th level, as a free action, a spirit shaman can assign her spirit guide the task of concentrating on a spell or spell-like ability that is maintained through concentration. The spirit shaman can act normally while her spirit guide concentrates on the spell. A spirit guide can concentrate on only one spell at a time. If necessary to maintain the spell, the spirit guide makes Concentration checks for the spirit shaman, using the spirit shaman&#39;s normal Concentration modifier. A spirit guide does not have to make Concentration checks for circumstances such as the spirit shaman taking damage. The spirit itself is not present for anyone to interrupt or otherwise interact with.",
      "recall spirit (sp)": "At 11th level, a spirit shaman gains the ability to call back the spirit of a dead creature before the spirit of the deceased has completely left the body. Once per week, she can reconnect a spirit to its body, restoring life to a recently deceased creature. The ability must be used within 1 round of the victim&#39;s death. This ability functions like raise dead, except that the raised creature receives no level loss, no thus may survive a blow that otherwise would have killed her. The rite&#39;s protection is discharged once it is triggered,",
      "exorcism (su)": "Starting at 13th level, as a full-round action, a spirit shaman can force a possessing creature or spirit out of the body it inhabits (for example, a ghost with the malevolence ability). To exorcise a possessing creature, she makes a class level check (also adding her Charisma modifier, if any), against a DC of 10 + the possessing creature&#39;s HD + its Charisma modifier (if any). If her result equals or exceeds the DC, she succeeds in forcing the possessor from the body, with the normal results based on its method of possession. A spirit so exorcised cannot attempt to possess the same victim for 24 hours.",
      "weaken spirits (su)": "At 16th level and higher, a spirit shaman can choose to strip spirits of their defenses instead of damaging them with her chastise spirits ability. When a spirit is weakened, it loses its spell resistance and any damage reduction overcome by magic weapons, silver or cold iron weapons, and aligned weapons (but not damage reduction overcome by adamantine weapons or not overcome by anything). In addition, an incorporeal spirit loses its immunity to nonmagical attack, its 50% chance to ignore damage from corporeal sources, and its ability to move into or through objects.",
      "spirit journey (sp)": "A spirit shaman knows how to vanish bodily into the spirit world beginning at 17th level. This ability functions like the spell shadow walk, except that a spirit shaman can only transport herself. She need not use the ability in a shadowy area, and she travels through the Plane of Spirits, not the Plane of Shadows. A spirit shaman can use this ability once per day.",
      "favored of the spirits (sp)": "At 19th level, a spirit shaman learns how to perform a special rite that guards her from death. Performing the rite requires 8 hours, and the spirit shaman must bargain away part of her life force, expending 1,000 experience points. The rite&#39;s effect lasts until it is dismissed or discharged.",
      "spirit who walks (ex)": "At 20th level, a spirit shaman becomes one with the spirit world. She is forevermore treated as a fey instead of a humanoid for purposes of spells and magical effects. Additionally, she gains damage reduction 5/cold iron."

      "weapon and armor proficiency": "Swashbucklers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor. Some of the swashbuckler&#39;s class features, as noted below, rely on her being no more than lightly armored and unencumbered.",
      "weapon finesse (ex)": "A swashbuckler gains <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/weapon-finesse--3103/\">Weapon Finesse</a> as a bonus feat at 1st level even if she does not qualify for the feat.",
      "grace (ex)": "A swashbuckler gains a +1 competence bonus on Reflex saves at 2nd level. This bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 20th level. A swashbuckler loses this bonus when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.",
      "insightful strike (ex)": "At 3rd level, a swashbuckler becomes able to place her finesse attacks where they deal greater damage. She applies her Intelligence bonus (if any) as a bonus on damage rolls (in addition to any Strength bonus she may have) with any light weapon, as well as any other weapon that can be used with Weapon Finesse, such as a rapier, whip, or spiked chain. Targets immune to sneak attacks or critical hits are immune to the swashbuckler&#39;s insightful strike. A swashbuckler cannot use this ability when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.",
      "dodge bonus (ex)": "A swashbuckler is trained at focusing her defenses on a single opponent in melee. During her action, she may designate an opponent and receive a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class against melee attacks from that opponent. She can select a new opponent on any action. This bonus increases by +1 at every five levels after 5th (+2 at 10th level, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th). A swashbuckler loses this bonus when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. ",
      "acrobatic charge (ex)": "A swashbuckler of 7th level or higher can charge in situations where others cannot. She may charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement or allies blocking her path. This ability enables her to run down steep stairs, leap down from a balcony, or to tumble over tables to get to her target. Depending on the circumstance, she may still need to make appropriate checks (Jump or Tumble checks, in particular) to successfully move over the terrain.",
      "improved flanking (ex)": "A swashbuckler of 8th level or higher who is flanking an opponent gains a +4 bonus on attacks instead of a +2 bonus on attacks. (Other characters flanking with the swashbuckler don&#39;t gain this increased bonus.)",
      "lucky (ex)": "Many swashbucklers live by the credo &quot;Better lucky than good.&quot; Once per day, a swashbuckler of 11th level or higher may re-roll any failed attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw. The character must take the result of the re-roll, even if it&#39;s worse than the original roll.",
      "acrobatic skill mastery (ex)": "At 13th level, a swashbuckler becomes so certain in the use of her acrobatic skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. When making a Jump or Tumble check, a swashbuckler may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so.",
      "weakening critical (ex)": "A swashbuckler of 14th level or higher who scores a critical hit against a creature also deals 2 points of Strength damage to the creature. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this effect. ",
      "slippery mind (ex)": "When a swashbuckler reaches 17th level, her mind becomes more difficult to control. If the swashbuckler fails her save against an enchantment spell or effect, she can attempt the save again 1 round later at the same DC (assuming she is still alive). She gets only this one extra chance to succeed at a certain saving throw. ",
      "wounding critical (ex)": "A swashbuckler of 19th level or higher who scores a critical hit against a creature also deals 2 points of Constitution damage to the creature. (This damage is in addition to the Strength damage dealt by the swashbuckler&#39;s weakening critical class feature.) Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this effect."

      "maneuvers": "You begin your career with knowledge of six martial maneuvers. The disciplines available to you are Desert Wind, Diamond Mind, Setting Sun, Shadow Hand, Stone Dragon, and Tiger Claw.",
      "maneuvers readied": "You can ready four of your six maneuvers known at 1st level, and as you advance in level and learn more maneuvers, you are able to ready more, but you must still choose which maneuvers to ready. You ready your maneuvers by meditating and exercising for 5 minutes. The maneuvers you choose remain readied until you decide to meditate again and change them. You need not sleep or rest for any long period of time to ready your maneuvers; any time you spend 5 minutes in meditation, you can change your readied maneuvers.",
      "stances known": "You begin play with knowledge of one 1st-level stance from any discipline open to you. At 2nd, 5th, 9th, 14th, and 20th level, you can choose additional stances. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended, and you do not have to ready them. All the stances you know are available to you at all times, and you can change the stance you currently use as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance description. ",
      "ac bonus": "Starting at 2nd level, you can add your Wisdom modifier as a bonus to Armor Class, so long as you wear light armor, are unencumbered, and do not use a shield. This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when you are flat-footed. However, you lose this bonus when you are immobilized or helpless.",
      "discipline focus (ex)": "As a swordsage, you can focus your training to take advantage of each discipline&#39;s fighting style. Each time you gain the discipline focus ability, select one of the six swordsage disciplines to which that focus applies. You can select a different discipline each time you gain discipline focus, but you must know at least one martial maneuver from the selected discipline. Even if you select a different discipline at higher levels, your discipline choice for earlier abilities does not change.",

If you succeed on a level check (DC 10 + the caster level of the weapon or armor), you can identify the properties of that item, including its enhancement bonus and special abilities. This ability does not reveal the properties of artifacts or legacy weapons, though it does indicate that such items are significantly powerful.",
      "evasion (ex)": "At 9th level, you can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion.",
      "improved evasion (ex)": "From 17th level on, you gain the benefit of improved evasion. You still take no damage if you make a successful Reflex save against an attack, and even if you fail the Reflex save, you take only half damage from the attack. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of improved evasion.",
      "dual boost (ex)": "When you reach 20th level, you can use two boost maneuvers simultaneously. whenever you initiate a boost maneuver, you can also initiate any other boost maneuver that you know as a free action. Both boosts you initiate are expended normally. You can use this ability three times per day."

She can designate any adjacent square as the square from which flanking against an ally is determined (including the square where she stands, as normal). She may designate the square at the beginning of her turn or at any time during her turn. The designated square remains her effective square for flanking until she is no longer adjacent to it or until she chooses a different square (at the start of one of her turns). The character can even choose a square that is impassable or occupied.",
      "sidestep (ex)": "At 2nd level, a tactical soldier gains <a href=\"/feats/miniatures-handbook--75/sidestep--2620/\">Sidestep</a> (described later in this chapter) as a bonus feat. If she already has the feat, she can choose a different one.",
      "interpose (ex)": "A tactical soldier gains this ability, usable three times per day, at 3rd level. When an enemy threatens her in melee and makes a successful attack against an adjacent ally of hers, the tactical soldier may take the damage (and other effects) of the blow as if she had been hit instead.",
      "defensive shield (ex)": "Starting at 4th level, whenever a tactical soldier fights defensively, she provides up to two adjacent allies with a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class, though their attack rolls do not take the normal &#8212;4 penalty (but her attack rolls still do).",
      "offensive strike (ex)": "Starting at 5th level, in times of urgency a tactical soldier can lower all her defenses to make a very aggressive attack. When making an offensive strike, the tactical soldier gains a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round. Until her next turn, however, she is wide open to physical and magical attacks. All successful attack rolls made against the tactical soldier are automatic threats, and all saving throws the tactical soldier makes against spells automatically fail.",
      "delayed cleave (ex)": "Starting at 7th level, if the last creature a tactical soldier hit in melee is dropped by someone other than her, and the tactical soldier still threatens that creature&#39;s square, she may make a cleave attack as an attack of opportunity. All normal restrictions on cleave attempts and attacks of opportunity apply.",
      "unbalancing blow (ex)": "Starting at 8th level, a tactical soldier can use a full-round action to make a strategic melee attack against an enemy. If the attack succeeds, in addition to dealing regular damage, the blow unbalances the target so much that it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures threatening its square. This ability works only on creatures up to one size category larger than the tactical soldier.",
      "reciprocal strike (ex)": "A 10th-level tactical soldier can make an attack of opportunity (subject to normal restrictions) against a foe that successfully attacks an ally of the soldier and deals damage. She can use this ability three times per day."

      "weapon and armor proficiency": "Thief-acrobats are proficient with all simple weapons.",
      "fast acrobatics (ex)": "A thief-acrobat can avoid the normal penalties for accelerated movement while using her acrobatic talents. She ignores the normal &#8212;5 penalty when making a Balance check while moving at her full normal speed. She can climb at half her speed as a move action without taking a &#8212;5 penalty on her Climb check. Finally, she can tumble at her full speed without taking the normal &#8212;10 penalty on her Tumble check.",
      "kip up (ex)": "A thief-acrobat can stand up from a prone position as a free action that doesn&#39;t provoke attacks of opportunity. This ability works only if the thief-acrobat wears light or no armor and carries no more than a light load.",
      "steady stance (ex)": "A thief-acrobat remains stable on her feet when others have difficulty standing. She is not considered flat-footed while balancing or climbing, and she adds her class level as a bonus on Balance or Climb checks to remain balancing or climbing when she takes damage.",
      "agile fighting (ex)": "A whirling, spinning thief-acrobat is a devilishly difficult target. Starting at 2nd level, a thief-acrobat gains a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class. When fighting defensively or using total defense, this bonus becomes +2. At 4th level, these bonuses increase by 1 (to +2 and +3, respectively). In addition, a thief-acrobat takes no penalty to her Armor Class or on her melee attack rolls when kneeling, sitting, or prone. This ability works only if a thief-acrobat wears light or no armor and carries no more than a light load.",
      "slow fall (ex)": "Beginning at 2nd level, a thief-acrobat reduces the effective distance of falls by 20 feet. At 4th level, this improves to reduce the effective distance of falls by 30 feet. See the monk class feature, page 41 of the Player&#39;s Handbook. If a thief-acrobat has this ability from another class, the distances stack to determine the effective reduction of the falling distance.",
      "acrobatic charge (ex)": "Starting at 3rd level, a thief-acrobat can charge in situations where others cannot. She can charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement or through allies blocking her path. This ability enables her to charge across a cluttered battlefield, leap down from a ledge, or swing across a chasm to get to her target. Depending on the circumstances, she may still need to make appropriate checks (such as Jump, Tumble, or Use Rope checks) to successfully move over the terrain.",
      "defensive roll (ex)": "Beginning at 3rd level, once per day a thief-acrobat can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the Player&#39;s Handbook. At 5th level, a thief-acrobat can use this ability twice per day.",
      "skill mastery (ex)": "At 4th level, a thief-acrobat has become so confident in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. When making a Balance, Climb, Jump, or Tumble check, she can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so.",
      "improved evasion (ex)": "A 5th-level thief-acrobat can avoid damage from certain attacks with a successful Reflex save and takes only half damage on a failed save. See the monk class feature, page 42 of the Player&#39;s Handbook."

      "bardic music</strong>: a troubadour of stars adds her class level to her bard level, if any, to determine what bardic music abilities she can use and how often she can use them. in addition, her troubadour levels stack with her bard levels for purposes of determining the bonus granted by her bestow courage ability. a troubadour of stars with no bard levels gains bardic music abilities as a bard of her class level.</p><p><em><strong>detect evil (sp)</strong></em>: at will, as the spell.</p><p><strong>holy cacophony (su)</strong>: a 2nd-level troubadour of stars with 8 or more ranks in perform can, as an extra bardic music effect, create a song of discordant notes that hampers evil creatures. any evil creature within 30 feet of the troubadour must make a successful concentration check (dc 15 + spell level) in order to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability. using the words of creation with this ability increases the save dc to 20 + spell level and deals 8d4 points of nonlethal damage to the troubadour. holy cacophony is a sonic, mind-affecting ability.</p><p><strong>celestial spells</strong>: once she reaches 2nd level, a troubadour of stars can cast spells as if she were an eladrin. specifically, the troubadour can learn and cast any spell described in chapter 6 that has a celestial or eladrin component, as long as she can otherwise cast the spell (it appears on her spell list, it is of a level of spells that she can cast, and she has a sufficient ability score to cast spells of that level).</p><p><strong>spells per day/spells known</strong>: at each even-numbered troubadour of stars level, the character gains new spells per day and spells known as if she had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level. the class must spontaneously cast spells (as a sorcerer or bard does). she does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bardic music abilities, improved familiar abilities, and so on). if the character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a troubadour of stars, she must decide to which class she adds each troubadour level for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.</p><p><em><strong>starmantle (sp)</strong></em>: at 3rd level, a troubadour of stars gains the ability to use <a href=\"/spells/book-of-exalted-deeds--52/starmantle--13/\"><em>starmantle</em></a>, as the spell (see chapter 6), once per day. her caster level is equal to her character level.</p><p><strong>song of hope (su)</strong>: a 5th-level troubadour of stars with 11 or more ranks in perform can, as an additional bardic music effect, inspire powerful hope in her allies. good-aligned creatures within 30 feet of the troubadour who are her allies gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls, as if affected by the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/good-hope--2552/\"><em>good hope</em></a> spell. in addition, affected creatures gain a new saving throw against any fear effect, despair effect (such as the <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/crushing-despair--2540/\"><em>crushing despair</em></a> spell), or similar mind-affecting condition, excluding &quot;<em>charm person</em>&quot;/spells/players-handbook-v35&#8212;6/charm-person&#8212;2535/, <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dominate-person--2547/\"><em>dominate person</em></a>, and similar spells. an affected creature may use the troubadour&#39;s perform check result in place of her saving throw if, after rolling the saving throw, the perform check result proves to be better. using the words of creation with this ability increases the morale bonus to +4 and deals 11d4 points of nonlethal damage to the troubadour. song of hope is a sonic, mind-affecting ability.</p><p><strong>sanctified spells</strong>: a 6th-level troubadour of stars can use sanctified spells as though they were among her spells known.</p><p><em><strong>eladrin form (sp)</strong></em>: at 7th level, a troubadour of stars gains the ability to use <a href=\"/spells/book-of-exalted-deeds--52/eladrin-form--106/\"><em>eladrin form</em></a>, as the spell (see chapter 6), once per day. her caster level is equal to her class level.</p><p><strong>celestial symphony (su)</strong>: a 9th-level troubadour of stars with 15 or more ranks in perform can, as an additional bardic music effect, create an effect that duplicates the holy word spell. nongood creatures within 30 feet of the troubadour are affected as though by the spell. the troubadour&#39;s caster level is equal to her class level. using the words of creation with this effect grants the troubadour a +4 bonus on her caster level check to overcome spell resistance and deals 15d4 points of nonlethal damage to the troubadour. celestial symphony is a sonic effect.</p><p><strong>celestial ascension (ex)</strong>: at 10th level, a troubadour of stars is so attuned to the ways of the eladrins that she becomes a magical creature. her type changes to outsider (native) and she gains damage reduction 10/unholy. unlike other outsiders, the troubadour can still be brought back from the dead.</p><h3>advancement</h3><table><tr><th>level </th><th><span

      "weapon and armor proficiency": "Urban druids eschew most forms of weaponry, preferring to use smaller and faster weapons that don&#39;t spread panic by their mere presence. Urban druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, crossbow (any), dagger, quarterstaff, rapier, sap, and short sword. They find armor to be distasteful and rude, and although they are proficient with padded, leather, and studded leather armor, they prefer to wear armor only when adventuring. The DM may allow urban druids to wear other forms of light armor that provide less than a +4 armor bonus as well. Urban druids are proficient with bucklers but no other shields.",
      "spells": "An urban druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the urban druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. An urban druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).",
      "chaotic, evil, good, and lawful spells": "A druid can&#39;t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity&#39;s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.",
      "city sense (ex)": "An urban druid gains a +2 bonus on Gather Information and Knowledge (local) checks.",
      "favored city (ex)": "At 1st level, an urban druid must select a favored city. This must be a settlement of at least small town size (<span class=\"caps\">DUNGEON</span> MASTER&#39;S Guide, page 137) or larger that the urban druid has visited, but need not be the city the urban druid currently calls home. As she gains levels, an urban druid may consider additional cities her favored cities.<br />While within the city limits of one of her favored cities, an urban druid gains a sacred bonus to all Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, and Intimidate checks equal to her Wisdom modifier. In addition, she gains a +2 morale bonus on all Will saving throws.",
      "urban companion (ex)": "An urban druid begins play with an urban companion selected from the following list: Small animated object, bat, dire rat, rat, cat, dog, riding dog, horse (light or heavy), Medium monstrous centipede, Small monstrous scorpion, Small monstrous spider, mule, owl, pony, raven, snake (Small or Medium viper), warhorse (light). This creature is a loyal companion that accompanies the urban druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind. A vermin serving as an urban companion has an Intelligence of 1, and its type changes to animal.",
      "crowdwalk (ex)": "At 2nd level, an urban druid can move through crowds with ease, moving as if in an open space. If an urban druid attempts to move through a square occupied by a hostile creature (such as with a Tumble check or an overrun attempt), she gains a +4 bonus on any skill check, Strength check, or attack roll made to resolve the movement.",
      "alley fighting (ex)": "Urban druids are masters at fighting in cramped quarters, such as city alleyways or narrow dungeon corridors. At 3rd-level, an urban druid&#39;s ability to fight in these conditions improves greatly. As long as she is fighting in an area no wider than her space (5 feet for a Small or Medium humanoid), she gains a +1 competence bonus on all attack rolls. Additionally, if she makes a melee attack against a target around a<br />corner, the target does not gain the benefit of cover (unless the foe has total cover). The urban druid retains the benefits of cover against her enemy, unless she is fighting another urban druid or other creature with a similar power.",
      "disease immunity (ex)": "At 4th level, an urban druid becomes immune to all forms of disease, including supernatural diseases like mummy rot.",
      "urban shape (su)": "At 5th-level, an urban druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium urban creature. This ability functions identically to a druid&#39;s wild shape ability, save that the list of forms the urban druid can take is much more specialized: It is limited to creatures with the humanoid type or to any non-construct creatures from her urban companion list (see above).",
      "information network (ex)": "Upon reaching 9th level, an urban druid has established an information network in a number of cities equal to her Charisma bonus. While in any of these cities, the urban druid only takes half an hour to make a Gather Information check (rather than a full evening or day). In addition, if any event occurs in a city that would interest the urban druid, she may make a Gather Information check to learn of the event as a free action. Knowledge of such an event reaches the urban druid&#39;s ears in 1d4 hours unless the urban druid is in an area that cannot be reached by her contacts."

You do not, however, gain any other benefi t a member of that class would have gained. If you had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming an urban savant, you must decide to which class you will add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known. If you had no levels in an arcane spellcasting class before acquiring the prestige class level, this class feature confers no advantage.",
      "urban savvy": "An urban savant is an expert on the local community. If something has been around for a while, you&#39;ve likely either heard stories about it or had direct contact with it. You can draw upon this extensive familiarity to gain certain benefits against the following types of creatures: aberrations, animals, humanoids, monstrous humanoids, oozes, and vermin (all of which are commonly found within the urban environment). The DM can modify this list as needed, replacing any creature type here with any other type appropriate to the campaign, or adding new ones. The benefits conferred are detailed in the descriptions below. As you grow in experience, you unearth new uses for your growing urban knowledge.",
      "urban empathy (ex)": "You can use your knowledge to improve the attitude of creatures you encounter in urban environments. This ability applies only to animals, humanoids, and monstrous humanoids (oozes and vermin being typically mindless). At the DM&#39;s discretion, this ability could work on certain aberrations as well, though most are too violent and unpredictable for such tactics.",
      "continuing education (ex)": "At 3rd level, you gain a +1 insight bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering), Knowledge (local), and Knowledge (nature) checks. You gain a similar bonus on all bardic knowledge checks. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level and +3 at 9th level.",
      "eyes of the city (ex)": "By the time you reach 5th level, your vision has surpassed that of ther city dwelling humans. You gain low-light vision, allowing you to see twice as far and as clearly as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similarly shadowy conditions. If you already have low-light vision, your existing ability improves, allowing you to see three times as far as a normal human in conditions of shadowy illumination."

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points, beyond those received from the prestige class, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that she adds the new level of vermin lord to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells knowns, and caster level accordingly. For example, if Silican, an 8th-level wizard, gains a level in vermin lord, he gains new spells as if she had risen to 9th level in wizard, bus he uses the other vermin lord aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonus. If he next gains a level of wizard, making him a 9th-level wizard/ 1st-level vermin lord, he gains spells as if she had risen to 10-th level wizard. ",

Furthermore, the vermin lord can attempt to start a grapple, provoking no attack of opportunity. If successful the mandibles automatically deal 2d6 points of damage each round as they suck blood from the victim. The blood drain ability only works on living creatures.",

Thus, a 7th-level vermin lord&#39;s swarm armor can absorb up to 35 points of damage, although no more that 10 points from any one attack.<br />If a vermin lord is already wearing armor, the swarm armor has no effect. ",

With these wings, he can fly at his normal land speed with average maneuverability for 1 hour.

Anyone in this area takes 1d6 points of damage per vermin lord level, with a successful Reflex save reducing the damage by half (DC 10 + vermin lord&#39;s class level + vermin lord&#39;s Con bonus).

At 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th, and 12th level, the character gains new spells per day and spells known as if she had also gained one level in a previous spellcasting class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit of the other spellcasting class. For example, if Isawa Todari, a 7th-level shugenja/1st-level Void disciple, gains a level in Void disciple, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 8th level in shugenja, but uses the other Void disciple aspects of level progression such as attack bonus and save bonus. If she next gains a level of shugenja, making her an 8th-level shugenja/ 2nd-level Void disciple, she gains spells as if she had risen to 9th level in shugenja.",
      "sense void (su)": "The first technique taught to the Void disciple is the ability to reach out with the mind and sense the world around, exploring the unseen layer of reality most people rarely experience. The Void disciple&#39;s consciousness actually departs her body and extends into the world, allowing her to use her normal senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell) to perceive whatever area, person, or thing she directs her attention to. The Void disciple must make a &quot;Scry&quot;skills/scry/ check, with the DC determined by distance, not familiarity.",
      "moment of clarity (su)": "At 4th level, a Void disciple can grant an ally the temporary ability to perform any skill or feat (with the exception of ancestor feats). The Void disciple must use a standard action to touch the target. The target gains either one feat or a number of ranks in one skill equal to his relevant ability modifier for that skill. For example, a character with a 14 Dexterity could gain 2 ranks in Ride, for a total skill modifier of +4. The effect lasts for 1 round per level of the Void disciple. The Void disciple can use this supernatural ability twice per day at 4th level, plus an additional use for every four additional levels she attains.",
      "altering the course (su)": "Once per day, a Void disciple of 7th level or higher can add a +20 bonus to any single attack roll, skill check, or ability check she makes. She cannot transfer this bonus to another character by any means. This supernatural ability requires no action, and lasts only the duration of the single check.",

For example, a severely wounded samurai could use his high Strength modifier in place of his low Dexterity modifier for a few rounds, increasing his Armor Class, Reflex save bonus, and ranged attack bonus (as well as Dexterity-based skills).",
      "void suppression (su)": "Once per day, a 12th-level Void disciple can make a melee touch attack to force the target to use his lowest ability score modifier in place of any one higher modifier (Void disciple&#39;s choice) for 5 rounds. For example, a Void disciple could force an ogre to use his low Intelligence modifier in place of his high Strength modifier, severely weakening the brute&#39;s physical blows.",
      "void strike (su)": "Once per day, a 13th-level Void disciple can make a melee touch attack to bestow 1d4 negative levels on the target. The Void disciple gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level she bestows. If the target has at least as many negative levels as HD, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature a -1 competence penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his highest available level. Negative levels stack. Assuming the target survives, he regains lost levels after 13 hours pass. This ability relies on the Void disciple&#39;s mastery of Void, not negative energy, so it cannot be used to benefit undead."

At every odd-numbered level thereafter, the dessication damage increases by 1d6 (or 1d8), to a maximum of 5d6 (or 5d8) at 9th level.

Once per day, you can blow sand into the face of a living opponent within 20 feet. Using this ability is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You can pick up dust from the ground as a move action or take it from a pouch as a free action. The opponent is entitled to a Reflex save (DC 10 + walker in the waste level + your Wis modifier) to avoid inhaling the dust. On a success, the dust has no effect and drifts harmlessly to the ground. An opponent who fails this save contracts the wasting, a supernatural affliction that gradually mummifies its victims (see Disease, page 21).",

      "greater drought (su)": "Beginning at 9th level, you can produce extreme desert conditions in a 100-foot radius emanation with you at the center. The temperature band in that area rises by two steps or to severe heat, whichever produces the hotter result. (See Heat Dangers and the effects of natural dehydration in Chapter 1.) You can suppress this effect for 1 round as a free action, but it renews automatically on your next turn unless you consciously suppress it again.

The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the war chanter sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally (or the war chanter herself) is inspired to recklessness, gaining the ability to decrease her Armor Class by a number less than or equal to her base attack bonus and add the same number to her melee attack rolls as a morale bonus.",

To be affected, a foe must be within 60 feet of the war chanter and must be able to hear the war chanter. Foes get a Will save (DC 10 + war chanter&#39;s class level + war chanter&#39;s Cha modifier) to resist the effect.

To be affected, an ally must be within 60 feet of the war chanter and must be able to hear the war chanter. Only allies who meet these requirements at the beginning of the song are affected, and an ally whose hearing is interrupted or who moves more than 60 feet away from the war chanter cannot rejoin the same song. The effect lasts as long as the affected characters can hear the war chanter and stay within range."

      "great swing (ex)": "Starting at 2nd level, a war hulk is able to make a great, sweeping swing with a melee weapon. As a full-round action, the war hulk can choose three squares adjacent to one another (he must threaten all of them). His attack applies to all creatures in those squares. Make one attack roll and apply that roll as an attack against each defender. If the war hulk uses a special attack (such as disarm, trip, or sunder), this special attack affects only the first target; the other creatures are attacked normally. Walls and similar obstacles can block a great swing. Start with one square that the war hulk threatens. Each successive square chosen must be adjacent to the previous square and have line of effect from that square. Two squares separated by a wall, for instance, can&#39;t be chosen as adjacent squares for a great swing. The war hulk may skip creatures, attacking only those he wants to. For example, if there are three creatures in a row&#8212;an enemy, an ally, and another enemy&#8212;the war hulk can choose those three squares for the great swing but strike only the two enemies. If a war hulk drops one of his foes with a great swing, he may make a cleave attack normally. However, he may do so only once for every time he swings, even if he drops more than one foe.",
      "mighty rock throwing (ex)": "Starting at 3rd level, a war hulk gains a powerful rock throwing ability. The character can throw rocks that deal 2d8 points of damage with a range increment of 50 feet. (Like all thrown weapons, they have a maximum range of five range increments.) The war hulk uses his Strength modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier on the attack roll. The rock must weigh approximately 50 pounds.",
      "mighty swing (ex)": "Starting at 4th level, a war hulk can make a mighty swing. A mighty swing is like a great swing, except that it is a standard action rather than a full-round action. Thus, the character can move and make a mighty swing or (if he can make multiple attacks) make multiple mighty swings in a single round.",
      "sweeping boulder (ex)": "Starting at 6th level, a war hulk is able to throw his rocks with such force that they affect two adjacent squares. (The second square must be farther away from the war hulk than the first&#8212;they cannot be equidistant from him.) Make one attack roll and apply the result to each target. As with great swing, the war hulk must have line of effect from one square to the next.",
      "toughness": "At 8th, 9th, and 10th level, a war hulk gains <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/toughness--2948/\">Toughness</a> as a bonus feat.",
      "massive sweeping boulder(ex)": "Starting at 8th level, a war hulk is able to throw his rocks with such force that they affect four squares in a line. (Each successive square chosen must be farther away from the character.) Only the first creature can be subject to damage from a critical hit or a sneak attack. As with great swing, the war hulk must have line of effect from one square to the next.",
      "massive swing (ex)": "A 10th-level war hulk can lash out all around himself with a single attack. Massive swing works like mighty swing, except that its effect is not limited to three squares. The war hulk&#39;s swing affects all squares he threatens."

Thus, when a character gains a new level of war wizard, she gains new spells per day as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (increased familiar powers, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on).",

At 2nd level and again at 4th level, the war wizard gains a bonus metamagic feat of her choice to add to her repertoire of knowledge.",
      "widen spell": "Part of the war wizard&#39;s training involves study of the essence of magic. In her training, she learns to adapt to the rapidly changing conditions of the battlefield. Although she may prepare some of her spells with metamagic feats, sometimes she needs to modify a spell on the spur of the moment. Beginning at 3rd level, a war wizard may cast a spell as if it were under the effects of the Widen Spell feat. She does not need to prepare this in advance, and it does not increase the casting time or use a higher spell slot. The war wizard can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma bonus (if any).",
      "enhanced spell area": "Particularly important to war wizards is the ability to use fewer spells to defeat their enemies, so they perfect their understanding of spell dimensions to cast spells affected by the Widen Spell metamagic feat with even greater area. Any time a war wizard of 5th level casts a spell modified by the Widen Spell feat, the area increases by 100% rather than 50%. Thus, instead of a widened <em>fireball</em> spell having a 30-ft.-radius spread, it has a 40-ft.-radius spread."

Multimorph allows a warshaper to change forms multiple times during the duration of the spell, spell-like ability, or class feature that enables her to change form. For example, a wizard/warshaper could <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/polymorph--2854/\"><em>polymorph</em></a> into a troll for 2 minutes, then change into a red dragon for 4 minutes, and then spend the rest of the spell&#39;s duration in the form of a hill giant. Each change requires a standard action, and only the first transformation heals the warshaper. If the warshaper changes into its natural form, the spell, spell-like ability, or use of wild shape ends."

This creature is stronger and more intelligent than others of its type. A waverider may have only one mount at a time. If the mount is slain, the waverider can call another one after a year and a day. See the Waverider Mount sidebar for more information.",
      "mounted weapon bonus (ex)": "At each level, a waverider gains the indicated bonus on her attack roll with the designated weapon while mounted.",
      "trident charge (ex)": "A waverider can use a trident to deal double damage when used from the back of a charging mount. The Spirited Charge feat can be used to increase the damage multiple to triple normal.",
      "ride bonus (ex)": "At 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level, a waverider gains the indicated bonus on Ride checks.",
      "breach (ex)": "On reaching 3rd level, a mounted waverider can make a leaping charge to attack opponents out of the water. The mount makes a Jump check using its own ranks in the skill or the waverider&#39;s, whichever is better, to make a &quot;running&quot; high jump as part of a charge, with a maximum height distance of twice its length. If it contacts an opponent during the jump, the waverider gains the normal +2 bonus on her attack roll. At the end of the jump, waverider and mount are once again submerged and thus do not take the &#8212;2 penalty to Armor Class against opponents out of the water (those underwater are still able to take advantage of the waverider&#39;s being temporarily off balance). A waverider cannot use this ability in two consecutive rounds.",
      "sound (ex)": "On reaching 4th level, a waverider can dive at high speed aspartofa charge when attacking opponents underwater. The mount makes a Jump check using its own ranks in the skill or the wave- rider&#39;s,<br />whichever is better, to make a &quot;running&quot; long jump as part of a charge, with a maximum distance of six times its length. If it contacts an opponent during the dive, the waverider gains a +4 bonus on her attack roll and increases the damage multiplier with her mounted weapon one more step (double to triple, triple to quadruple) but takes a &#8212;4 penalty to Armor Class for the next round. A waverider cannot use this ability in two consecutive rounds.",
      "improved mounted archery (ex)": "At 5th level, a waverider is better able to use a crossbow, harpoon, javelin, tri- dent, or shortspear while mounted. When making ranged attacks with any of these weapons while mounted, she takes only a &#8212;1 penalty on ranged attacks if the mount is making a double move, and &#8212;2 if the mount is running.",
      "full mounted attack (ex)": "At 6th level, a waverider may attack as a standard action when its mount moves more than 5 feet rather than as a partial action.",
      "skim (ex)": "On reaching 7th level, a mounted waverider can make more effective charges against opponents out of the water, skimming over the surface like a flying fish. The mount makes a Jump check using its own ranks in the skill or the waverider&#39;s, whichever is better, to make a &quot;running&quot; long jump as part of a charge, with a maximum distance of four times its length, and a &quot;running&quot; high jump with a max- imum vertical distance of twice its length. (Use the same roll to determine both height and length.) If it contacts an opponent during the jump, the waverider gains the normal +2 bonus on its attack roll. At the end of the jump, waverider and mount are once again submerged and thus do not take the &#8212;2 penalty to Armor Class against opponents out of the water (those underwater are still able to take advantage of the waverider&#39;s being temporarily off balance). A waverider cannot use this ability in two consecutive rounds.",
      "superior mounted archery (ex)": "At 8th level, a waverider takes no penalties when making ranged attacks with a crossbow, harpoon, javelin, trident, or shortspear while mounted.",
      "wavedancing (ex)": "On reaching 9th level, a mounted waverider can maneuver very effectively out of the water. Rider and mount can move up to four times the mount&#39;s swim speed out of water and can make charges, including Ride-By Attacks if the waverider has this feat (normal charge rules apply). In addition, she can now use her breach, sound, and skim abilities in consecutive rounds.",
      "call of the deeps (su)": "At 10th level, a waverider can summon one or more water elementals once per day, as with a <a href=\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/planar-ally--2417/\"><em>planar ally</em></a> spell."

      "seelie courtier (ex)": "At 1st level, you must choose either the seelie or the unseelie path. Good-aligned characters can&#39;t choose the unseelie path, while evil-aligned characters are barred from the seelie path. This choice determines certain benefits you gain from this prestige class. If your alignment later changes to make your choice illegal, you automatically exchange all seelie- or unseelie-related class features for their opposites.",
      "spontaneous spells": "A wild soul can tap into the magic that naturally infuses fey and magical beasts to cast spells that were not prepared ahead of time. You can sacrifice any prepared arcane spell (or, for a spontaneous caster, an arcane spell slot) to cast a particular spell of the same spell level or lower. Depending on whether you have chosen the seelie or unseelie path, you choose from different specific spells as specified on the table below. You gain access to these spontaneous spell options by level. Access to a spontaneous spell does not grant the ability to cast it if you do not have a prepared spell or spell slot of appropriately high level to lose in exchange.",
      "seelie bond (su)": "When you cast <em>summon seelie ally</em> or a <em>summon monster</em> spell to bring forth a creature from the <em>summon seelie ally</em> list, your connection to the seelie increases, granting you benefits. These benefits remain as long as one of the seelie or unseelie creatures you summoned is alive and the duration of the spell has not expired. The benefits described below are cumulative. Thus, a 10th-level wild soul would gain all of them upon summoning a seelie or unseelie ally.",
      "summon seelie ally (sp)": "Starting at 2nd level, a wild soul can summon a seelie ally three times per day. This ability functions like <em>summon monster I</em> except that you choose a creature from a list of options, as detailed on the table below, based on your wild soul level and path. You can use this ability to summon one creature from the highest-level list available to you, 1d3 creatures of the same kind from the next highest-level list, or 1d4 +1 creatures of the same kind from any lower-level list. Your caster level is equal to your character level."

From 1st level, she retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)",
      "defensive roll (ex)": "A yakuza can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it. Once per day, when a yakuza would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the yakuza can attempt to roll with the damage. She makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if she&#39;s successful, she takes only half damage from the blow. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll&#8212;if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can&#39;t roll. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the yakuza&#39;s evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.",
      "improved evasion (ex)": "At 2nd level and above, a yakuza can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If the yakuza makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Even if she fails her saving throw, she takes only half damage. The yakuza can use improved evasion only if she is wearing light armor or no armor.",
      "yakuza knowledge (ex)": "A yakuza, if she&#39;s doing her job, knows everything that goes on in her &quot;territory,&quot; and a lot about what goes on outside it. A yakuza may make a special yakuza knowledge check with a bonus equal to her class level + her Intelligence modifier to see whether she knows some relevant information about local people or places. The yakuza may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. The DM will determine the Difficulty Class of the check by referring to the table below:",
      "leadership": "At 5th level, a yakuza gains the <a href=\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/leadership--1740/\">Leadership</a> feat for free. Yakuza belong to an adoptive family, and can call on other members of their families for assistance. A yakuza&#39;s followers may be rogues as well as warriors, experts, or commoners. If the yakuza already has the Leadership feat, she gains a permanent +2 bonus on her Leadership score.",
      "slippery mind (ex)": "At 10th level, a yakuza gains the ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a yakuza with slippery mind is affected by magic and fails her saving throw, 1 round later she can attempt her saving throw again. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed at her saving throw."
