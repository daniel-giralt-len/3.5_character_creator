spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other<br />benefi t a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming an abolisher, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.","favored enemy (ex)":"At 1st level, your hatred of aberrations grants you a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against aberrations. Likewise, you gain a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. At 4th level, and then again at 8th level, this bonus increases by 2. If you possess the favored enemy (aberrations) feature from another source, these bonuses stack.","wild shape (su)":"You gain the druid ability to use wild shape once per day. Your abolisher wild shape is somewhat more limited than a full druid\'s wild shape ability, though, and you are limited to Medium animals. The ability otherwise works as detailed on page 37 of the Player\'s Handbook. As you gain levels, you gain additional uses of this ability per day. At 4th level, you can use wild shape two times per day, and at 8th level you can do so three times per day. If you already have wild shape uses from another class, such as druid, these wild shape uses stack. If you have druid levels, each time you gain a level of abolisher, you add 1 to your effective druid level to determine the maximum Hit Dice of a creature you can wild shape into and how long each use of wild shape lasts. The type and size of animal that you can wild shape into does not improve from abolisher levels.","animal companion":"If you have an animal companion, your abolisher levels stack with your previous class levels (usually druid or ranger) to determine the animal companion\'s abilities. If you do not already have an animal companion, you do not gain one from this ability.","winds of nature\'s grace (ex)":"At 2nd level and higher, you gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws made against attacks from aberrations. The bonus increases to match your Charisma bonus, if any (minimum of +2) when you use wild shape or other magic to assume the form of an animal, elemental, or plant.","pierce aberrant defense (ex)":"Many aberrations possess some degree of spell resistance, and abolishers train to overcome this spell resistance. Beginning at 3rd level, you gain a +1 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome an aberration\'s spell resistance. This bonus increases to +2 at 6th level, and then to +3 at 9th level. These bonuses stack with those granted by the Spell Penetration and Greater Spell Penetration feats.","crystals of nature\'s wrath (su)":"At 5th level and higher, your wild shape natural attacks are enhanced with jagged crystals. These crystals are harmless to most creatures, but to aberrations they cause terrible welts and acidlike burns. An aberration struck by one of your natural weapons must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + abolisher level + Cha modifi er) or become sickened for 1 minute. An aberration that makes its saving throw is immune to this effect for the duration of that use of wild shape.","waves of nature\'s purity (su)":"Beginning at 7th level, you can create a rippling aura of white vapor that spreads in a 20-foot radius. The vapor does not obscure vision, and it is cool and refreshing against the skin of nonaberrations. Against aberrations, the waves of nature\'s purity are foul and unsettling. An affected aberration must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + abolisher level + Cha modifi er) each round or become nauseated for that round. You can use this ability once per day, and the power lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifi er (minimum 1 round). Activating this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.","fires of nature\'s rage (su)":"A 10th level, you can infuse your wild shape form with fl ickering ghostly fi re three times per day. The fi res of nature\'s rage burn any aberration that comes in contact with them. Your natural attacks do an extra 3d6 points of fi re damage against aberrations, and an aberration that hits you, even with a weapon, takes 3d6 points of fire damage. You can activate the fires of nature\'s wrath as a free action, as long as you are in wild shape form. Doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and each activation lasts for 1 round."},"class skills":["concentration","escape artist","gather information","heal","intimidate","knowledge

","chaotic breach, minor (su)":"At 6th level, you can breach reality itself, allowing the chaotic influence of Limbo to seep into reality. You can trigger a breach a number of times per day equal to your class level. Once a breach comes fully into being, it has a duration of 1 round per class level (you can dismiss it early as a free action).

The attraction can be toward a particular person, object, action, or event. The target takes all reasonable steps to get close to the person, find the object, attend the event, or perform the action designated, though it does not suffer from blind obsession and does not take extreme risks to do so. The subject can recognize danger but does not flee unless the threat is immediate. If the ancient master specifies herself as the object of the attraction, she cannot command the subject indiscriminately, though the subject does listen to her (even if it disagrees). This ability grants the ancient master a +4 bonus on Charisma checks made to influence the subject for the duration of the effect. Attraction lasts for 1 hour. This ability is usable once per day at 1st level and an additional once per day every three ancient master levels thereafter (twice per day at 4th level, three times per day at 7th level, and four times per day at 10th level). This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.","conceal thoughts (sp)":"At 2nd level, an ancient master can protect her own thoughts (but not those of any other creature) from analysis. She gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against divination effects that reveal emotions or thoughts and a +20 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks made to oppose Sense Motive checks. This ability is always active.","body equilibrium (ex)":"A 3rd-level or higher ancient master can adjust her body density to match that of any solid or liquid she stands on. Thus, she can walk on water, quicksand, or even a spider\'s web without sinking or breaking through. (This ability does not confer any resistance to particularly sticky webs.) She can move at her normal speed, but she cannot run on an unfirm surface without sinking or breaking through. If she falls while using this ability, damage from the impact is halved. This ability is usable at will.","levitate (sp)":"Upon reaching 4th level, an ancient master can use <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/levitate--2830/\\">levitate</a> (caster level equals ancient master level) once per day. She gains one additional use per day of this ability at 7th level and another at 10th level.","dimension door (sp)":"At 5th level, an ancient master can use <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dimension-door--2388/\\">dimension door</a> (caster level equals ancient master level) once per day. She gains one additional use per day of this ability at 8th level.","shadow concealment (su)":"At 6th level, an ancient master gains the ability to take on shadow form for 1 minute per ancient master level. While in this state, she becomes incorporeal, appearing as a shadowy image of herself. She gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Hide checks while this ability is in effect. The ancient master gains one additional use per day of this ability at 9th level.","baleful teleport (sp)":"At 7th level, an ancient master can disperse miniscule portions of a target creature or object weighing no more than 300 pounds. The target takes 9d6 points of damage from this attack. A successful Will save (DC 10 + ancient master level + ancient master\'s Cha modifier) halves the damage. A target under a dimensional anchor effect is immune to baleful teleport. This ability is usable once per day at 7th level and twice per day at 10th level. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.","claws of the vampire (sp)":"When an ancient master reaches 8th level, she can cause the fingers on both her hands (if she has any) to grow to wicked, 2-inch-long points. She gains a claw attack (base damage 1d8 points) that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Whenever she uses this attack, she heals one-half the base damage that she deals with claws of the vampire. She can use this ability in conjunction with feats, abilities, or spells that allow additional attacks in the same round. This effect lasts for 1 hour per ancient master level and can be used once <br />per day. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level spell.","mind probe (sp)":"Once per day, a 9th-level or higher ancient master can read the thoughts of any one living creature within 30 feet that fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + ancient master level + ancient master\'s Cha modifier). All the target\'s memories and knowledge are accessible to her, from memories deep below the surface to those easily called to mind. She can learn the answer to one question per round, to the best of the target\'s knowledge. She can also probe a sleeping target, though it may make a Will save (DC 10 + ancient master level + ancient master\'s Cha modifier) to wake after each question. Targets that do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the ability\'s range unless somehow hindered. The ancient master poses the questions telepathically<br />and the answers are imparted directly to her mind. She and the target do not need to speak the same language, though less intelligent creatures may yield up only appropriate visual images in answer to her questions. Creatures protected by mind blank are immune to this ability. Mind probe lasts for 1 minute per ancient master level. This ability is the equivalent of a 5th-level spell.","disintegrate (sp)":"A 10th-level ancient master can use <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/disintegrate--2801/\\">disintegrate</a>

club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, shuriken, siangham, and sling. The arcanopath monk gains the same advantages for using a kama, nunchaku, or siangham as does a monk.","student of perfection":"arcanopaths are monks, although they meditate on alternative methods of achieving physical enlightenment. as such, an arcanopath monk gains flurry of blows, unarmed damage, ac bonus, and unarmored speed as if he were a monk whose level equaled his monk level + his arcanopath monk level. for instance, a 6th-level monk/1st-level arcanopath has a base flurry ofblows attack bonus of +4/+4 (as if he were a 7th-level monk). those who manage to meet the requirements for this class who are not monks gain these abilities as if a monk equal to only their arcanopath monk level.","clap of deafness (su)":"The monk can use this supernatural ability once per round, but no more than once per arcanopath level per day. The monk must declare he is using the clap of deafness before making the attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). A foe struck by the arcanopath is forced to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + the arcanopath level + the arcanopath\'s Wisdom modifier), in addition to taking damage as normal If the saving throw fails, the opponent is deafened for 1 round. A deafened character has a 20% chance of spell failure when casting spells with verbal components (as well as suffering a -4 penalty on initiative checks and an inability to make Listen checks). Unless specified to the contrary, all spell failure penalties stack. Creatures immune to critical hits or sonic attacks cannot be affected by the arcanopath\'s clap.","chop of silence (su)":"The arcanopath of at least 2nd level can use this supernatural ability once per round, but no more than once per arcanopath level per day. The arcanopath must declare he is using the chop of silence attack before making the attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). A foe struck by the arcanopath is forced to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + the arcanopath level + the arcanopath\'s Wisdom modifier), in addition to taking damage as normal. If the saving throw fails, the opponent is rendered mute for 1 round. A mute character is unable to cast spells with a verbal component (and cannot communicate verbally). Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected by the chop.","strike of confusion (su)":"The monk of 3rd or higher level can use this supernatural ability once per round, but no more than once per arcanopath level per day. The monk must declare he is using the strike of confusion before making the attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). A foe struck by the arcanopath is forced to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + the arcanopath level + the arcanopath\'s Wisdom modifier), in addition to taking damage as normal. If the saving throw fails, the opponent has a 50% chance of spell failure when casting any spell (or attempting to use a spell-like ability) for 2d4 rounds. Unless specified to the contrary, all spell failure penalties stack. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected by the strike.","deflect spell (su)":"At 4th level, the arcanopath monk learns to deflect incoming ray and energy missile spells. The arcanopath must have at least one hand free (holding nothing) to use this ability. Once per round when the arcanopath would normally be hit with a ray or energy missile spell the character can make a DC 20 Reflex saving throw (if the ray or energy missile has a magical bonus to attack, the DC increases by that amount). If the arcanopath succeeds, he deflects the spell. The arcanopath must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ray or energy missile doesn\'t count as an action.","ki strike (su)":"Beginning at 5th level, an arcanopath\'s unarmed attack is empowered with ki and is treated as if it were made of cold iron for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.","allseeing eye (su)":"The 6th-level arcanopath gains the ability to see as if enjoying the effects of a permanent see invisibility spell cast by a 5th-level sorcerer. This supernatural ability functions continuously.","slap of forgetfulness (ex)":"The arcanopath monk of 7th or higher level can use this extraordinary ability once per round, but no more than once per arcanopath level per day. The monk must declare he is using the slap of forgetfulness attack before making the attack roll (thus, a missed attack roll ruins the attempt). A foe struck by the arcanopath is forced to make a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + the arcanopath level + the arcanopath\'s Wisdom modifier), in addition to taking damage as normal. If the saving throw fails, the opponent loses 1d4 arcane spells (or 1d4 unused daily arcane spell slots). The lost spells or spell slots are lost first from the highest level spells the spellcaster can cast, but otherwise are determined by the creature struck. If the result indicates more spells lost than are prepared (or unused) at a particular level, spells at the next lower level are lost in the same fashion, and so on. Lost spells (or open spell slots) can be regained normally. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected by the slap of forgetfulness.","empty hand (ex)":"An 8th-level arcanopath monk gains the ability to make melee attacks against ethereal creatures. Reflect Spell (Su): Starting at 9th level, when an arcanopath monk successfully deflects a spell he can choose to reflect it back at the caster. An arcanopath can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day). A reflected spell is, in effect, cast back on the original caster, although the monk rerolls any necessary attack roll (associated DCs<br />are unchanged).","sundering strike of oblivion (ex)":"When an arcanopath monk of 10th level makes a successful slap of forgetfulness, he can automatically convert it to a sundering strike of oblivion once per day. In addition to taking normal damage and losing 1d4 prepared arcane spells (or 1d4 unused daily arcane spell slots), the foe completely loses knowledge of the lost spells. Spellcasters who lose knowledge of spells may later attempt a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + spell level + the arcanopath\'s Wisdom modifier) to regain each one. Failure indicates the spell is unavailable until the next time the spellcaster advances a level, at which time the spellcaster automatically relearns all her forgotten spells (as well as gains knowledge of new spells as normal for the class)."},"class skills":["balance","climb","concentration","craft","diplomacy","escape artist","hide","jump","knowledge (arcana)","listen","move

(ex)":"You have the service of a loyal ashworm that serves you as a mount. Unlike the ashworms sold as regular mounts, this ashworm\'s poison stinger is not clipped. Moreover, it never tries to submerge when it reaches open sand, as ashworms sold as mounts do. Finally, your ashworm serves readily as a combat steed. To ride your mount, you need special tack, harness, and an exotic saddle, all of which costs 70 gp.","saddle bonus (ex)":"You gain a competence bonus equal to your class level on all Handle Animal and Ride checks associated with your ashworm while you are mounted.","bonus feat":"At 2nd and 9th level, you can choose a bonus feat from the fighter bonus feats given in the Player\'s Handbook.","heightened sting (ex)":"Wild ashworms, and ashworms chosen as mounts by dragoon characters, have a poisonous stinger (normal saddle-broken ashworms sold as mounts have their stinger clipped for the rider\'s safety). At 3rd level and higher, you can induce your mount to make a heightened sting attack in conjunction with your regular attacks that round. When making a heightened sting attack, the ashworm\'s attack roll modifier is equal to your base attack bonus + the ashworm\'s Str modifier. On a successful hit, the victim\'s Fortitude save DC to resist the poison is 10 + 1/2 your character level + the ashworm\'s Con modifier. This is a special attack, and it can be made only once per round, and a total number of times per day equal to your class level.","relentless shield (ex)":"At 4th level and higher, you can make a Ride check after any attack that successfully strikes your ashworm mount, in an attempt to negate the hit on your ashworm. Normally, the Mounted Combat feat allows you to make this attempt only once per round. See the Mounted Combat feat, page 98 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>, for details. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on Ride checks made to negate an opponent\'s attack roll. This ability does not extend to any other type of mount.","stamp into the sand (ex)":"At 5th level, you gain Trample as a bonus feat. Instead of using a hoof, the ashworm makes one sting attack against the knocked down target. If you already have the Trample feat (or gain it later), you gain an extra benefit: When mounted on your ashworm, a foe you have knocked down using Trample is so thoroughly flattened that rising from a prone position requires a full-round action instead of a move action. ","sand rider (su)":"Upon reaching 6th level, you have formed such a close bond with your mount that you are able to stay with the ashworm when it travels beneath the sand. During these trips, you have learned the trick of tightening your harness, just so, while at the same time guiding your sandswimming mount in an expert manner that allows you to cling to the ashworm\'s back without being swept off, and without fear of suffocation. This ability does not allow you to remain attached when the ashworm burrows through solid earth (but see the earth rider class feature, below), and you can travel in this manner for 1 minute per class level at a time before you and your mount must surface for air. ","full mounted attack (ex)":"Beginning at 7th level, you can make a full attack when your mount moves more than 5 feet but no farther than its speed as a single move action. You cannot combine this full attack with a charge action.","spirited worm (ex)":"You gain Spirited Charge as a bonus feat at 8th level. If you already have Spirited Charge (or gain it later), you gain an extra benefit: When mounted on your ashworm and using the charge action, you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage (or 2d6 with a lance). This ability does not extend to any other type of mount. ","earth rider (su)":"At 10th level, your bond with your mount is so close that you are able to stay with the ashworm even when it travels beneath packed earth. During these trips, you have learned the trick of quickly adjusting your harness, while at the same time guiding your burrowing mount in an expert manner that allows you to cling to the ashworm\'s back without being swept off, and without fear of suffocation. You can travel in this manner for 1 minute per class level at a time before you and your mount must surface for air. An ashworm cannot burrow through solid rock. If it is forced to stop burrowing (such as if it is slain) while you are on its back, you are subject to the normal hazards of being buried alive."},"class skills":["climb","craft","handle

It requires a move action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.","bonus speed (ex)":"The battle dancer moves with speed and agility earned through countless hours of practice, physical training, and study of the precise, fluid movements of her battle dances. She gains a +10- foot bonus to speed at 4th level. She gains additional +10-foot bonuses at 10th level and 16th level.","dance of the vexing snake (su)":"A 5th-level battle dancer with 8 ranks in Tumble gains the ability to dodge her opponent\'s blows with her sudden, unpredictable maneuvers. She can use the Tumble skill to move at her normal speed without penalty, and she can Tumble a distance up to her current speed.","dancer\'s strike (su)":"The magic of the battle dancer\'s arcane maneuvers allows her to manifest auras of energy around her feet and hands. These auras can defeat an opponent\'s damage reduction. The battle dancer can generate this aura as a standard action at will. It persists for a number of rounds equal to 5 + the battle dancer\'s Charisma modifier before it fades.","dance of the floating step (su)":"The battle dancer moves with such grace and speed that she can dance across water. An 8th-level battle dancer with 11 ranks in Tumble can cross the surface of a liquid, such as water or magma, without taking damage or sinking below the surface. If she ends her movement on such a liquid, she takes damage and sinks as normal. The battle dancer must begin her movement on a stable, firm surface.","dance of the springing tiger (su)":"An 11th-level battle dancer with 14 ranks in Tumble can spring upon an opponent with the ferocity of a tiger. When charging, she can attempt a DC 20 Tumble check. If she succeeds, she may make a full attack rather than a standard attack as part of her charge.","dance of the crushing python (su)":"The battle dancer\'s speed and mighty unarmed strikes combine to make her a fearsome opponent. She can step into an opponent\'s reach and confuse it with a series of feints and quick blows, distracting it from other threats. A 14th-level battle dancer with 17 ranks in Tumble can rain a series of hammering blows upon a foe. She must use the Tumble skill to enter her opponent\'s space without provoking an attack of opportunity. If she succeeds, she may then attack her opponent while in its space. If the battle dancer\'s attack hits, her opponent takes a -2 penalty to AC and it cannot make attacks of opportunity until the start of the battle dancer\'s next action. After the battle dancer completes her attack, she enters a square of her choice adjacent to the target.","dance of the soaring eagle (su)":"A 17th-level battle dancer with 20 ranks in Tumble gains a fly speed equal to her base land speed with average maneuverability. If a flying battle dancer charges an opponent below her, she gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 bonus on damage in place of the normal benefits of charging. She may use her dance of the springing tiger in conjunction with an aerial charge.","dance of death\'s embrace (su)":"A 20th-level battle dance with 23 ranks in Tumble can perform a vicious, deadly dance to defeat her opponent. Before using this dance, the battle dancer selects a single target within 30 feet. As a full-round action, the battle dancer performs an elaborate dance that requires a DC 35 Tumble check to complete. If she succeeds, any time she makes a successful attack against her designated target she deals +2d6 points of damage. In addition, any critical threat the battle dancer makes against her designated target is automatically confirmed as a critical hit. This ability lasts until the end of the battle dancer\'s next turn."},"class skills":["balance","climb","escape artist","hide","jump","listen","move silently","open lock","perform","sleight of hand","swim","tumble"],"alignment":"Any Chaotic","requirements":{}},"60":{"name":"Battle Maiden","link":"/classes/oriental-adventures--96/battle-maiden/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"69","requirements":{"bab":7,"alignment":["any lawful"],"skills":["Handle Animal","Ride"],"feats":["Mounted Combat","Ride-By Attack","Spirited Charge"],"gender":"Female"},"skill points":{"base":2,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":1,"fort":2,"ref":0,"will":0,"special":["Special mount",2]},{"level":2,"bab":2,"fort":3,"ref":0,"will":0,"special":["Burst of speed"]},{"level":3,"bab":3,"fort":3,"ref":1,"will":1,"special":[2]},{"level":4,"bab":4,"fort":4,"ref":1,"will":1,"special":["Defensive riding"]},{"level":5,"bab":5,"fort":4,"ref":1,"will":1,"special":[4]},{"level":6,"bab":6,"fort":5,"ref":2,"will":2,"special":[""]},{"level":7,"bab":7,"fort":5,"ref":2,"will":2,"special":[4]},{"level":8,"bab":8,"fort":6,"ref":2,"will":2,"special":["Heal mount"]},{"level":9,"bab":9,"fort":6,"ref":3,"will":3,"special":[6]},{"level":10,"bab":10,"fort":7,"ref":3,"will":3,"special":[""]}],"hit die":10,"class features":{"weapon and armor proficiency":"Battle maidens are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light and medium armor.","special mount":"A battle maiden\'s mount is no ordinary animal.

When you gain access to a new level of spells, you automatically know all the spells for that level on the beguiler\'s spell list. You can cast any spell you know without preparing it ahead of time. Essentially, your spell list is the same as your spells known list. You also have the option of adding to your existing spell list through your advanced learning class feature (see below) as you increase in level.","armored mage (ex)":"Normally, armor of any type interferes with an arcane spellcaster\'s gestures, which can cause your spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A beguiler\'s limited focus and specialized training, however, allow you to avoid any chance of arcane spell failure as long as you restrict yourself to light armor. This training does not extend to any other form of armor, nor does this ability apply to spells gained from other spellcasting classes.","trapfinding":"Beguilers can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20.

","surprise casting (ex)":"Starting at 2nd level, when you successfully use the Bluff skill to feint in combat, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus (if it has one) to AC for the next melee attack you make against it or the next spell you cast. You must remain in melee with the target, and the attack must be made or the spell cast on or before your next turn. The target is not considered flat-footed and therefore can make attacks of opportunity against you if you do not cast defensively.","advanced learning (ex)":"At 3rd level, you can add a new spell to your list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a sorcerer/wizard spell of the enchantment or illusion school and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell you already know. Once a new spell is selected, it is forever added to your spell list and can be cast just like any other spell on your list.","silent spell":"At 5th level, you gain Silent Spell as a bonus feat.

If the mark triggers the bloodhound\'s readied action at any point within the next 10 minutes, the bloodhound can carry out his readied action as if the two were engaged in combat (as long as the bloodhound is capable of carrying out that action). If the bloodhound is incapable of carrying out the action&#8212;for instance, if he is too far away to strike the mark with a readied melee attack&#8212;the readied action is lost.","bring \'em back alive (ex)":"At 3rd level and higher, a bloodhound can turn a potentially killing blow into an incapacitating one&#8212;all the better to bring a mark back for punishment. At the bloodhound\'s option, any melee attack that would reduce a foe to &#8212;2 or fewer hit points reduces the foe to &#8212;1 hit points instead. A bloodhound must choose to use this ability immediately upon reducing his foe to &#8212;2 or fewer hit points, and before making any other action (or even continuing a full attack). A raging bloodhound can\'t use this ability.","tenacious pursuit (ex)":"At 3rd level and above, a bloodhound tracking a mark gains a +4 bonus on Constitution checks made to resist nonlethal damage from a forced march (see page 164 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>). In addition, a bloodhound tracking a mark can increase his own speed by 10 feet, up to a maximum value equal to the mark\'s speed. This bonus stacks with all other speed increases. At 6th level, the speed increase improves to 20 feet, and it goes up to 30 feet at 9th level.","hunter\'s dedication (ex)":"Beginning at 4th level, a bloodhound adds his Constitution bonus (if any) to Will saves made to resist the special attacks or spells of his mark. ","move like the wind (ex)":"Starting at 4th level, a bloodhound can move stealthily even at a quick pace. He no longer takes a &#8212;5 penalty on Hide and Move Silently checks when moving at any speed up to his normal speed, and he takes only a &#8212;10 penalty (instead of a &#8212;20 penalty) on Hide and Move Silently checks when running. (He takes the normal &#8212;20 penalty when attacking or charging.)","crippling strike (ex)":"Starting at 5th level, a bloodhound can deliver strikes against his mark with such precision that each successful attack also deals 2 points of Strength damage to the mark. A bloodhound can deliver a crippling strike with a melee attack, or with a ranged wind attack from a distance of up to 30 feet. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook.</em>","track the trackless (su)":"Starting at 5th level, a bloodhound can track a creature moving under the<br />influence of <em>pass without trace</em> or a similar effect, though he takes a &#8212;20 penalty on his Survival checks when doing so.","see invisibility (su)":"This ability, gained at 6th level, functions like a <em>see invisibility</em> spell, except that it is constantly in effect and it reveals only invisible marks.","shielded mind (su)":"At 6th level, a bloodhound gains spell resistance against divination spells equal to 15 + his bloodhound level. This benefit does not stack with other forms of spell resistance.","locate creature (sp)":"Once per day, a bloodhound of 7th level or higher can produce an effect identical to that of a <em>locate creature</em> spell with a caster level equal to the bloodhound\'s character level.","freedom of movement (su)":"Starting at 8th level, a bloodhound can act normally regardless of magical effects that impede movement, as if he were affected by a <em>freedom of movement</em> spell. The effect lasts for a total time per day of 1 round per point of Wisdom bonus he possesses (minimum 1 round). The effect occurs automatically as soon as it is applied, lasts until it runs out or is no longer needed, and can be used multiple times per day (up to the total daily limit of rounds). The character\'s caster level is equal to his bloodhound level.","scent (ex)":"At 9th level, a bloodhound gains the scent ability (see page 314 of the <em>Monster Manual</em>).","find the path (sp)":"A 10th-level bloodhound can use <em>find the path</em> twice per day as the spell. His caster level is to his bloodhound level."},"class skills":["bluff","climb","diplomacy","disguise","gather information","heal","hide","intimidate","jump","listen","move silently","open

He does not, however, gain all the benefits a character of that class would have gained (metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spell-casting. If a character had more than one arcane spellcasting class before becoming a bonded summoner, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.","elemental companion (ex)":"At 1st level, a bonded summoner picks his element of study: air, earth, fire, or water. This choice cannot be changed. The bonded summoner calls a Medium elemental of the type chosen, which replaces his familiar. The elemental gets abilities according to the information in the table below. At 3rd level, his elemental companion grows to Large. At 5th level, it grows to Huge. At 7th level, the companion becomesa greater elemental, and at 9th level it becomes an elder elemental. If the elemental companion dies, the bonded summoner takes damage equal to the elemental\'s Hit Dice. The bonded summoner also takes 1d4 points of damage to each ability score.

This extra damage increases by +1d6 points evert four levels (+2d6 at 5th level and +3d6 at 9th level) Should the cancer mage score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. ","disease host (ex)":"At 1st level, a cancer mage suffers no ill effects of diseases, except for purely cosmetic ones such as boils, pockmarks, watery eyes, blackened skin, hair loss, foul smell, and so on. The cancer mage becomes a carrier of every disease he encounters, though he remains immune to most of their effects. However, the cancer mage takes 1d6 points of damage per caster level if someone casts a cure disease spell or effect on him (he can make a Fortitude save to try to resist the effect). Furthermore, if the cancer mage has a cancerous companion (see below), he loses all abilities gained from the companion for 1d10 days after being the subject of a cure disease spell.","cancerous companion (ex)":"At 2nd level, a cancer grows within the cancer mage, forming a large tumor. This cancerous growth gains intelligence and a personality distinct from the cancer mage. The companion and the cancer mage can communicate telepathically. When needed, the cancerous companion uses the cancer mage\'s scores for saves, ability scores other than Intelligence, and so forth. The cancerous companion gains abilities as the cancer mage gains levels.","tatterdemalion (ex)":"Gathering scraps of clothing and old, discarded rags, a 3rd-level cancer mage is able to make such articles into light armor with a the following stats: armor bonus +4, maximum Dex bonus +5, armor check penalty &#8212;1, arcane spell failure 15%, speed 30 ft./20 ft., weight 20 lb. Only a 3rd-level or higher cancer mage can wear this armor and gain these benefits; other wearers treat it as padded armor. This armor is considered masterwork quality and can be fashioned into magic armor.","children of the night (su)":"A 4th-level cancer mage commands the lesser creatures of the world and can call forth a swarm of 2d6 Small monstrous spiders or a pack of 4d8 dire rats or a swarm of 10d10 bats, once per day, as a stan- dard action. These creatures arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the cancer mage (understanding his mental commands) for up to 10 minutes per class level.","viral agent (su)":"At 5th level, a cancer mage befriends a disease or virus that infests his body. He supernaturally enhances a disease, making it smarter by giving it a point of his own Intelligence. He establishes a telepathic link with the disease that functions at a range of one mile per class level of the cancer mage.","insect armor (su)":"By allowing insects and worms to crawl over his body, a 7th-level cancer mage gains a +4 natural armor bonus. The cancer mage cannot wear armor heavier than light armor and keep this benefit, however.","viral ally (su)":"In a fashion similar to the viral agent ability, a cancer mage of 8th level or higher can create a viral ally by devoting 3 points of Intelligence to a disease or virus in his system. The cancer mage can then bestow his viral ally upon a humanoid victim using his contagion ability, and the viral ally can communicate telepathically with the cancer mage. The viral ally (and thus the cancer mage) controls its host as surely as with a <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dominate-person--2547/\\"><em>dominate person</em></a> spell, although the host gets no separate saving throw to avoid the <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dominate-person--2547/\\">_ dominate person_</a> effect. The viral ally is a normal disease, however, and the victim can fight it off with successful Fortitude saves or a cure disease spell, either of which kills the viral ally. The cancer mage regains his missing Intelligence points 24 hours later. A cancer mage can create as many viral allies as he is willing to devote Intelligence points toward.","disease form (su)":"At 10th level, a cancer mage gains the ability to tranform into a disease once per day.

She must succeed at a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level + opponent\'s Intelligence modifier) to uncover a spell.

She gains a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. A cloud anchorite must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC of more than 0, but she can always choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while climbing. She cannot use the run action while climbing. She retains her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their attacks against her while she is climbing. A cloud anchorite in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed. As the cloud anchorite gains levels, her climb speed increases. At each odd-numbered level, she gains a +10-foot bonus to her current climb speed. If the cloud anchorite already possesses a climb speed (for example, if she possessed a racial climb speed before becoming a cloud anchorite), these bonuses stack with her current climb speed.","wisdom of the mountain (ex)":"A cloud anchorite adds her Wisdom modifier on Balance, Climb, and Jump checks made in mountain terrain. In addition, the cloud anchorite can always take 10 on a Balance, Climb, or Jump check, even if circumstances would normally prevent her from doing so.","slow breath (ex)":"At 2nd level, a cloud anchorite\'s breathing slows to a fraction of what it used to be. She can hold her breath twice as long as normal, and gains a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saving throws against inhaled poisons, fatigue caused by high elevation, and altitude sickness. At 6th level, her bonus on these Fortitude saving throws increases to +6.","bonus feat":"At 3rd level and again at 7th level, a cloud anchorite gains a bonus feat. This feat must be selected from the following list, and she must qualify for any prerequisites the feat to be chosen might require: Acrobatic, Agile, Athletic, Cold Endurance, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Improved Cold Endurance, Self-Sufficient, Skill Focus (in any class skill), or Track.","resistance to cold (su)":"At 4th level, a cloud anchorite gains resistance to cold 5. This increases to resistance to cold 10 at 8th level.","fast movement (ex)":"At 4th level, a cloud anchorite gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus to her land speed. A cloud anchorite in armor (even light armor) or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed. At 8th level, this bonus increases to +20 feet.","empty stride (su)":"At 5th level, a cloud anchorite\'s stride is nearly weightless. She gains a +4 bonus on all Balance checks. More impressively, she can walk on the surface of any material into which she would normally sink, such as powdery snow, thin ice, and even water. She may continue to walk on this surface as long as she makes a DC 15 Concentration check. Normally, the Concentration check for this activity is a standard action, so a cloud anchorite may make one move action per round while using her empty stride ability. If she makes a DC 30 Concentration check, she may concentrate on her Empty Stride ability as a move action instead, allowing her to use it and still take one standard action in a round. She does not trigger traps that use pressure plates while using empty stride, nor is her speed impacted by deep snow.","acrobatic charge (ex)":"At 6th level, a cloud anchorite gains the ability to charge in situations where others cannot. She may charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement. This enables her to run down steep rock faces, leap down from an outcropping, or tumble over small boulders to get to the target of her charge.

A daggerspell mage can cast a spell with somatic and material components even when holding a dagger in each hand. If a daggerspell mage holds anything other than a dagger, he must have at least one hand free to cast a spell with somatic or material components. Casting a spell in this way still provokes attacks of opportunity normally. In addition, a daggerspell mage can deliver a touch spell with a dagger attack (either a melee touch attack or a normal melee attack, but not with a thrown dagger).","invocation of the knife (su)":"Beginning at 2nd level, daggerspell mages develop a strong mystical connection between their arcane spellcasting abilities and the daggers that they wield. Whenever a daggerspell mage casts an arcane spell that deals energy damage, he can turn half of the damage dealt by the spell into magic slashing damage rather than energy damage. Energy resistance does not apply to this damage, but damage reduction might. This power does not affect a creature\'s ability to resist the affected spell with a saving throw or spell resistance. Using this ability does not require an action; its use is part of the action required to cast the affected spell. Only spells with a duration of instantaneous can be modified by this ability.","spells per day/spells known":"Beginning at 2nd level, a daggerspell mage gains new spells per day at each level (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class level.

This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 6th level and 3d6 points at 9th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>.

At 5th level and higher, a mage can hold the charge for one touch spell for each dagger that he is holding in his hands. He must designate which dagger holds each touch spell at the time the spell is cast. If one of these daggers leaves the daggerspell mage\'s hands, the spell immediately discharges harmlessly (unless the dagger is thrown by a mage with the arcane throw ability; see below).","arcane infusion (su)":"At 7th level and higher, a daggerspell mage can infuse arcane spell power into his daggers, temporarily enabling them to deal extra energy damage. To use this ability, a mage must lose a prepared arcane spell from memory (or give up a potential spell slot for the day if he casts spells as a sorcerer). The daggerspell mage chooses one dagger that he is holding and an energy type (fire, cold, or electricity) when this ability is activated. The chosen dagger deals an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the spell level sacrificed. Multiple uses of this ability on the same dagger don\'t stack, even if different energy types are chosen. If the dagger is thrown, the energy damage applies to that attack, but then the effect immediately dissipates. Using this ability is a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity (see Swift Actions and Immediate Actions, page 137).","arcane throw (ex)":"At 8th level and higher, a daggerspell mage can imbue arcane spell power into his thrown daggers. The mage can deliver a touch spell with a thrown dagger just as if he were making a melee attack. If the dagger hits, the touch spell is discharged against the creature or object struck. If the dagger misses its intended target, the dagger returns to the mage just before his next turn (as if it had the returning special ability; see page 225 of the <em>Dungeon Master\'s Guide</em>) and retains the spell just as if the mage had missed with a melee attack.","daggerspell flurry (ex)":"A 10th-level daggerspell mage can blend spellcasting with a flurry of dagger attacks. When using this ability, a daggerspell mage can quicken one spell as part of a full attack with his daggers. Doing this has no effect on the spell\'s effective level. A daggerspell mage must make at least one melee attack in any round in which he uses this ability, and he cannot make an attack with anything other than a dagger (although if a spell cast in conjunction with this ability requires an attack roll, he can still make the spell\'s attack).

Levels of the daggerspell shaper prestige class stack with druid levels for the purpose of determining the maximum duration of the wild shape ability; they do not stack for any other purpose (such as the size and type of creature that a shaper can become). ","dagger claws (su)":"When a daggerspell shaper of 2nd level or higher uses wild shape, she adds any magical properties of daggers that she is holding in each hand into the natural attacks of her new form. The magic of a single dagger affects only the natural attacks made with the corresponding limb in the shaper\'s animal form, not all her attacks. For example, a 2nd-level daggerspell shaper holding a +1 <em>flaming dagger</em> in one hand and a +2 <em>keen dagger</em> in the other hand transforms into a leopard. The daggers affect the claw attacks of her new form as follows: One gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls and also gains the flaming special ability, and the other gains a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls and also gains the keen special ability. If the assumed form does not have a claw or slam attack with a limb that corresponds to the druid\'s natural limbs, this ability has no effect. The bonuses from this ability last for the duration of the wild shape effect. When a shaper uses this ability, her natural weapons in animal form overcome damage reduction exactly as do the daggers that she was holding when she transformed. In the example above, the shaper would be able to overcome a foe\'s damage reduction as if both of her natural weapons were magic.","spells per day/spells known":"Beginning at 2nd level, a daggerspell shaper gains new spells per day at each level (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a divine spellcasting class to which she belonged before adding the prestige class level.

If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the dark hunter\'s class level + the dark hunter\'s Int modifier) against the kill effect, he dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the victim\'s mind and body become enervated, rendering him helpless and unable to act for 1d6 rounds plus 1 round per level of the dark hunter. If the victim\'s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the dark hunter has completed the 3 rounds of study, she must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds.

The deepsong can be seen, felt, heard, and tasted, and it even makes itself known in mystical ways. While underground, the deepsong fills you with a sense of belonging and welcome. This effect grants you a +2 morale bonus on all Will saving throws. In addition, your stone tell spell-like ability becomes much more powerful than the normal spell. When you use this ability, the stones relate complete descriptions of events when asked. You can gain knowledge of up to three facts from among the following topics with each use: the layout of caverns and tunnels; the presence of plants and fungi, minerals, bodies of water, or people; local animal population; and the presence of elemental creatures, powerful abominations, or undead.","improved cavefighting (ex)":"At 8th level, your cavefighting techniques improve further. You can take 10 at any time with any of the following skills while underground, even if you are threatened or distracted: Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Jump, and Swim. <br />In addition, you master a style of fighting that incorporates the terrain into your attacks. You might cause an opponent to slip with a successful attack and twist an ankle on loose rocks or to stagger into a sharp stalactite. You might brace yourself against a cave wall to get a little bit of extra pull on your bow. In any case, this fighting style works only if you are standing in a square of difficult terrain.

For a limited number of rounds per day, you can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. While stonewalking, you have a burrow speed equal to your base land speed; this burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of a presence. A move earth spell cast on an area where you are stonewalking flings you back 30 feet and stuns you for 1 round if you fail a DC 15 Fortitude save. <br />You can stonewalk for a number of rounds each day equal to 10 + your Intelligence modifier. These rounds need not be continuous; you can activate this ability for 4 rounds to pass through a collapsed tunnel and still have the remainder of your rounds available for use later in the same day. Activating and deactivating stonewalking is a free action. If you are still burrowing when you run out of time, you are immediately ejected into the nearest open surface large enough to contain you. Distance is not a factor, but the ejection is quite painful and forces you to make a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per 5 feet traveled to reach the open area) or be stunned for 1d4 rounds."},"class skills":["balance","bluff","climb","craft","diplomacy","escape artist","gather information","heal","hide","intimidate","jump","knowledge (architecture and engineering)","knowledge (dungeoneering)","knowledge (geography)","knowledge (local)","knowledge (nature)","listen","move silently","search","sense motive","speak language","spot","survival","swim","tumble"]},"169":{"name":"Darksong Knight (Fighter)","link":"/classes/champions-of-valor--28/darksong-knight-fighter/","isPrestige":false,"bookId":"6","requirements":{},"skill points":{"base":2,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":2,"bab":2,"fort":3,"ref":0,"will":0,"special":["Bonus feat","dancing feint"]},{"level":6,"bab":6,"fort":5,"ref":2,"will":2,"special":["Bonus feat",2]},{"level":8,"bab":8,"fort":6,"ref":2,"will":2,"special":["Bonus feat","combat dancing"]}],"hit die":8,"class features":{},"class skills":[]},"170":{"name":"Darkwood Stalker","link":"/classes/complete-warrior--61/darkwood-stalker/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"16","requirements":{"bab":5,"race":"ElforHalf-elf","skills":["Hide","Listen","Move Silently","Spot","Survival"],"feats":["Dodge","Track"],"language":["Orc"]},"skill points":{"base":4,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":1,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":0,"special":[2]},{"level":2,"bab":2,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":0,"special":["Uncanny dodge"]},{"level":3,"bab":3,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":1,"special":[6]},{"level":4,"bab":4,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":1,"special":[4,"darkvision 30 ft."]},{"level":5,"bab":5,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":1,"special":["Improved uncanny dodge"]},{"level":6,"bab":6,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":2,"special":[6]},{"level":7,"bab":7,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":2,"special":[6,"darkvision 60 ft."]},{"level":8,"bab":8,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":2,"special":["Dodge critical"]},{"level":9,"bab":9,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":3,"special":[6]},{"level":10,"bab":10,"fort":7,"ref":7,"will":3,"special":[8,"death attack"]}],"hit die":8,"class features":{"weapon and armor proficiency":"Darkwood stalkers gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.","ancient foe (ex)":"Due to his extensive study of orcs and training in the proper techniques for combating them, a darkwood stalker gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against orcs.

Long ago, elven sages developed a ritual to allow the most dedicated stalkers to overcome this disadvantage. Now, as they grow in experience, their night vision continually improves, eventually matching the darkvision of their hated foes. At 4th level, a darkwood stalker gains darkvision out to 30 feet, and at 7th level, the range increases to 60 feet. If the darkwood stalker already has darkvision as a racial ability, this ability does not increase it. ","improved uncanny dodge (ex)":"At 5th level and higher, a darkwood stalker can no longer be flanked, since he can react to opponents on opposite sides of him as easily as he can react to a single attacker. This defense denies other characters the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack him. The exception to this defense is that a rogue of at least four levels higher than the character can flank him (and thus sneak attack him). If a darkwood stalker gains the uncanny dodge ability from another class, the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.","dodge critical (ex)":"Although often more skilled than their orc foes, darkwood stalkers have seen too many battles won by one lucky blow from a falchion. At 8th level, a darkwood stalker becomes able to turn even the luckiest blow into a grazing strike. Once per day, a darkwood stalker can make a Reflex saving throw (DC 20 + the enhancement bonus, if any, possessed by the weapon) to turn a critical hit dealt upon him into a normal hit. The darkwood stalker must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed, and he must declare his attempt to reduce the effect of the critical hit before the damage from the hit is rolled.","death attack (ex)":"If a 10th-level darkwood stalker studies a particular orc for 3 rounds and then makes a sneak attack with a melee weapon that successfully deals damage, the sneak attack has the additional effect of possibly killing the target. While studying the orc, the darkwood hunter can undertake other actions as long as his attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect the darkwood stalker or recognize the darkwood stalker as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 10 + the darkwood stalker\'s class level + the darkwood stalker\'s Wis modifier), he dies. If the victim\'s saving throw succeeds, the attack is just a normal sneak attack. Once the darkwood stalker has completed the 3 rounds of study, he must make the death attack within the next 3 rounds. If a death attack is attempted and fails (the victim makes his save) or if the darkwood stalker does not launch the attack within 3 rounds of completing the study, 3 new rounds of study are required

Charisma is a key attribute in his ability to rebuke undead and force them into service.","weapon and armor proficiency":"A death master is proficient with the club, crossbow (light and heavy), dagger, scimitar, scythe, sickle, and staff. Death masters are proficient with light armor but not with shields of any type.","bonus language":"The death master gains Abyssal as a bonus language. All of his spells, along with most death master tomes and manuals, appear in that tongue.","rebuke undead":"As an emissary of Orcus, a death master has the power to compel undead to serve him. He channels Orcus\'s fell energy and uses it to turn the living dead into his pawns. The death master can attempt to rebuke undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A death master with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gains a +2 bonus on rebuking checks against undead.","spells":"The death master\'s exhaustive study of necromantic magic grants him the ability to use arcane spells. The death master can cast the spells given on the death master spells list. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time, as a wizard.<br />To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a death master must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell\'s level. The DC for a saving throw against the death master\'s spells equals 10 + the spell\'s level + the death master\'s Intelligence modifier. The death master receives bonus spells for having a high Intelligence score.","spellbooks":"The deathmaster keeps a set of unholy tomes that record the blasphemous, arcane methods for his spells. His spellbooks function in all ways as a wizard\'s spellbooks, including size, capacity, and cost to add spells.","undead minion":"A death master gains the services of an undead creature bestowed unto him by Orcus, typically a wolf skeleton or a zombie troglodyte. With your DM\'s permission you can gain the services of a different skeleton or zombie creature with a total, post- template CR of 1 or lower.","master of the dead (su)":"As a herald of Orcus, the death master is the unquestioned master of the living dead. An undead creature must make a Will save (DC 10 + half the death master\'s level + his Charisma modifier) in order to attack him in any way. If this save fails, the undead creature cannot take any aggressive action against the death master for 24 hours. If the undead creature succeeds in this save, it can act normally for 24 hours. After this time, it must save again.","sustenance of the dead (su)":"A loth-level death master gains power from the negative energy that infuses undead creatures. Once per round as a free action the death master can draw energy from a single undead creature he controls. The undead creature must be within 60 feet of the death master. When the death master user this power, he reduces the undead creature to a pile of dust and gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die of the undead creature. These temporary hit points fade after 1 hour.","lichdom":"At 20th level, the death master gains the lich template. Having proved himself as one of Orcus\'s most treasured followers, the death master attains the mantle of undeath. Even nonhumanoid death masters gain this template, although usually they are ineligible for it. Already undead death masters gain the lich\'s benefits listed under armor class, special attacks, turn resistance, damage reduction, abilities, and skills. These granted abilities stack with any the undead death master already possessed.","undead minion basics":"Use the base statistics for a creature of the minion\'s kind, as given in the Monster Manual, but make the following changes.","special abilities":"As the death master gains levels, his undead minion gains a number of special abilities.","4th level or higher (level -3)</strong><br />bugbear zombie<br />ghoul<br />owlbear skeleton<br /><strong>7th level or higher (level -6)</strong><br />chimera skeleton<br />minotaur zombie<br />ogre zombie<br />wyvern zombie<br /><strong>10th level or higher (level -9)</strong><br />allip<br />ettin skeleton<br />ghast<br />gray render zombie<br />wight<br /><strong>13th level or higher (level -12)</strong><br />cloud giant skeleton<br />mummy<br />wraith<br /><strong>16th level or higher (level -15)</strong><br />spectre</p><h3>advancement</h3><table><tr><th colspan=\\"6\\"></th><th colspan=\\"10\\">spells per day </th></tr><tr><th>level </th><th><span class=\\"caps\\">bab</span> </th><th>fort </th><th>ref </th><th>will </th><th>special </th><th>0th </th><th>1st </th><th>2nd </th><th>3rd </th><th>4th </th><th>5th </th><th>6th </th><th>7th </th><th>8th </th><th>9th </th></tr><tr><td> 1st </td><td> +0 </td><td> +0 </td><td> +0 </td><td> +2 </td><td> rebuke undead, spells, undead minion </td><td> 3 </td><td> 1 </td><td> &#8212;

Her choice of martial weapon is made when the character takes her first level of dread necromancer and cannot be changed.","spellcasting":"A dread necromancer casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the dread necromancer\'s spell list (see page 87). Like a sorcerer, she can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. When a dread necromancer gains access to a new level of spells, she automatically knows all the spells for that level given on the dread necromancer\'s spell list. Dread necromancers also have the option of adding to their existing spell list through their advanced learning ability as they increase in level (see below).","charnel touch (su)":"Negative energy flows through a dread necromancer\'s body, concentrating in her hands. At will, but no more than once per round, she can make a melee touch attack against a living foe that deals 1d8 points of damage, +1 per four class levels. This touch heals undead creatures, restoring 1 hit point per touch, +1 per four class levels. A dread necromancer can use the spectral hand spell to deliver this attack from a distance.","rebuke undead (su)":"A dread necromancer can rebuke or command undead creatures by channeling negative energy through her body. See the cleric class feature described on page 33 of the Player\'s Handbook.","lich body":"Starting at 2nd level, a dread necromancer begins her journey into undeath. The first symptom is her body\'s increased resilience to physical harm. She gains DR 2/bludgeoning and magic. As the dread necromancer increases in level, this DR increases in effectiveness, to DR 4 at 7th level, DR 6 at 11th level, and DR 8 at 15th level. ","negative energy burst (su)":"Beginning at 3rd level, a dread necromancer gains the ability to emit a burst of negative energy from her body, harming living creatures within 5 feet of her. This burst deals 1d4 points of damage per class level. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + Cha modifier) reduces damage by half. Undead creatures within this burst are healed the same amount of hit points as the damage she deals to living creatures. A dread necromancer can use this ability once per day at 3rd level, and one additional time per day for every five levels she attains beyond 3rd (2/day at 8th level, 3/day at 13th level, and 4/day at 18th level).","advanced learning (ex)":"At 4th level, a dread necromancer can add a new spell to her list, representing the result of personal study and experimentation. The spell must be a cleric or wizard spell of the necromancy school, and of a level no higher than that of the highest-level spell the dread necromancer already knows. Once a new spell is selected, it is added to that dread necromancer\'s spell list and can be cast just like any other spell she knows. If a spell is both a cleric spell and a wizard spell, use the lower of the two spell levels (when different) to determine what level the spell is for a dread necromancer. A dread necromancer gains an additional new spell at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level.","mental bastion":"Starting at 4th level, a dread necromancer gains a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist sleep, stunning, paralysis, poison, or disease. This bonus increases to +4 at 14th level.","fear aura (su)":"Beginning at 5th level, a dread necromancer radiates a 5-foot-radius fear aura as a free action. Enemies in the area must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier) or become shaken. A creature who successfully saves cannot be affected by that dread necromancer\'s fear aura for 24 hours.","scabrous touch (su)":"Starting at 6th level, once per day a dread necromancer can use her charnel touch to inflict disease on a creature she touches. This ability works like the <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/contagion--2721/\\"><em>contagion</em></a> spell (see page 213 of the Player\'s Handbook), inflicting the disease of her choice immediately, with no incubation period, unless the target makes a successful Fortitude save (DC10 + 1/2 her class level + her Cha modifier). The DC for subsequent saving throws to resist the effects of the disease depends on the disease inflicted; see page 292 of the Dungeon Master\'s Guide for details. ","summon familiar":"At 7th level or anytime thereafter, a dread necromancer can obtain a familiar. The familiar she acquires is more powerful than a standard wizard\'s or sorcerer\'s familiar, but it is unequivocally evil. The player of a dread necromancer character chooses one of the following creatures: imp (devil), quasit (demon), vargouille, or ghostly visage. All these creatures are described in the Monster Manual except for the ghostly visage, an undead symbiont described on page 221 of the Fiend Folio.","undead mastery":"All undead creatures created by a dread necromancer who has reached 8th level or higher gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity and 2 additional hit points per Hit Die.","negative energy resistance":"Beginning at 9th level, a dread necromancer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist negative energy effects, including energy drain, some ability drain, and <em>inflict</em> spells.","light fortification":"Starting at 10th level, a dread necromancer gains 25% resistance to critical hits; this is the equivalent of the light fortification armor special ability described on page 219 of the Dungeon Master\'s Guide. At 17th level, this fortification increases to 50%. ","enervating touch (su)":"When a dread necromancer reaches 12th level, she gains the ability to bestow negative levels when she uses her charnel touch attack. Each day, she can bestow a total number of negative levels equal to one-half her class level, but no more than two negative levels with a single touch. The saving throw to remove the negative levels has a DC of 10 + 1/2 her class level + her Charisma modifier.","craft wondrous item":"At 19th level, the dread necromancer gains <a href=\\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/craft-wondrous-item--483/\\">Craft Wondrous Item</a> as a bonus feat. This helps her prepare the phylactery required to become a lich. ","lich transformation":"When a dread necromancer attains 20th level, she undergoes a hideous transformation and becomes a lich. Her type changes to undead, and she gains all the traits of the undead (see page 317 of the Monster Manual). She no longer has a Constitution score, all her existing Hit Dice become d12s, and she must reroll her hit points. A dread necromancer need not pay experience points or gold to create her phylactery."},"class skills":["bluff","concentration","craft","decipher script","disguise","hide","intimidate","knowledge (arcana)","knowledge (religion)","profession","spellcraft"],"requirements":{}},"245":{"name":"Dread Pirate","link":"/classes/complete-adventurer--54/dread-pirate/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"9","requirements":{"bab":4,"alignment":["any nonlawful."],"skills":["Appraise","Profession","Swim","Use Rope"],"feats":["Quick Draw","Weapon Finesse"],"special":"The character must own a ship worth at least 10,000 gp.

Allies within sight or hearing of a dread pirate add an insight bonus equal to half this number on their Profession (sailor) checks.","two-weapon fighting":"A dread pirate wearing light or no armor is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the prerequisites for the feat.","fearsome reputation (ex)":"By the time he attains 2nd level, a dread pirate has developed a reputation on the high seas. At this point, he must choose whether to cultivate a reputation as an honorable pirate (avoiding undue bloodshed, honoring flags of truce, and the like) or as a dishonorable pirate (favoring mayhem and dire treatment of prisoners).","rally the crew (ex)":"Starting at 3rd level, an honorable dread pirate can inspire his allies (including himself) to great bravery in combat once per day. This inspiration grants them a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and weapon damage rolls. To be affected, an ally must be able to see or hear the dread pirate. The effect requires a free action to activate and lasts for 1 minute per class level, even if the dread pirate moves out of range or loses consciousness. This is a mind-affecting ability. ","sneak attack (ex)":"Beginning at 3rd level, a dishonorable dread pirate deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>. The amount of extra damage dealt increases to 2d6 at 7th level. If a dishonorable dread pirate gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.","acrobatic charge (ex)":"A dread pirate of 4th level or higher can charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement or through the squares occupied by allies blocking his path. This ability enables him to charge across a cluttered ship\'s deck, leap down from a higher deck, or swing between two adjacent ships to get to his target. Depending on the circumstances, he might still need to make appropriate checks (such as Jump, Tumble, or Use Rope checks) to successfully move over the terrain.","steady stance (ex)":"At 4th level and higher, a dread pirate remains stable on his feet when others have difficulty standing. He is not considered flat-footed while balancing or climbing, and he adds his class level as a bonus on Balance or Climb checks to remain balancing or climbing when he takes damage.","luck of the wind (ex)":"Once per day, an honorable dread pirate of 5th level or higher can reroll any failed attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw. He must take the result of the reroll, even if it\'s worse than the original roll.","scourge of the seas (ex)":"Starting at 5th level, a dishonorable dread pirate can instill fear into his enemies. When the character uses Intimidate to demoralize foes, the attempt affects all enemies within 30 feet who can see and hear him, and the effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Multiple uses of this ability don\'t stack. This is a mind-affecting ability.","skill mastery (ex)":"At 8th level, a dread pirate becomes supremely confident of his mobility. He has mastered the skills Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble to the extent that he can take 10 with them even under stress.","fight to the death (ex)":"At 9th level and higher, an honorable dread pirate can inspire his allies to carry on against tremendous odds. Each ally affected by the dread pirate\'s rally the crew ability (see above) also gains temporary hit points equal to 10 + the dread pirate\'s Cha bonus (minimum 10), gains a dodge bonus to Armor Class equal to the dread pirate\'s Cha bonus (minimum +1), and is treated as having the Diehard feat even if he doesn\'t meet the prerequisites. These effects are lost if the dread pirate loses consciousness.","motivate the scum (ex)":"Once per day, a dishonorable dread pirate of 9th level or higher can motivate his allies by killing a helpless individual. All allies of the dread pirate who see the act gain a +2 morale bonus on damage rolls. This effect lasts for 24 hours.","pirate king (ex)":"A 10th-level dread pirate\'s exploits have become so legendary that great numbers of able sailors are willing to sign on as his crew for no compensation other than a share of the booty.

weapon or armor.","drink like a demon (ex)":"A drunken master\'s body handles alcohol differently from other people\'s. He can drink a large tankard of ale, a bottle of wine, or a corresponding amount of stronger alcohol as a move action. Every bottle or tankard of alcohol he consumes during combat reduces his Wisdom and Intelligence by 2 points each, but increases his Strength or Constitution (character\'s choice) by 2 points. A drunken master may benefit from a number of drinks equal to his class level. The duration of both the penalty and the bonus is a number of rounds equal to the character\'s drunken master level + 3.","improvised weapons (ex)":"While bottles and tankards are a drunken master\'s preferred improvised weapons, he can use furniture, farm implements, or nearly anything else at hand to attack his foes. A drunken master\'s improvised weapon deals as much damage as his unarmed strike plus an extra 1d4 points. Most improvised weapons deal bludgeoning damage, although some (a broken glass bottle, for example) would deal piercing or slashing damage. When a drunken master rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll while using an improvised weapon, that weapon breaks apart and becomes useless.","stagger (ex)":"By tripping, stumbling, and staggering, a drunken master of 2nd level or higher can make a charge attack that surprises his opponents. This ability has two beneficial aspects: First, the charge need not be in a straight line, even though the character can still move up to twice his speed. Second, if a drunken master makes a DC 15 Tumble check before beginning a charge, his movement through threatened squares provokes no attacks of opportunity.","swaying waist (ex)":"At 3rd level, a drunken master knows how to weave and bob during an attack, making him more difficult to hit. The character gains a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against any one opponent he chooses during his turn.","ac bonus (ex)":"At 4th level, a drunken master gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class. This bonus improves to +2 at 9th level.","improved improvised weapons (ex)":"A drunken master of 4th level or higher can use long improvised weapons (such as ladders) as reach weapons according to their length, and improvised weapons with many protrusions (such as chairs) provide a +2 bonus on opponents\' disarm attempts. Finally, large objects with broad, flat surfaces (such as tables) can be upended to become improvised tower shields.","greater improvised weapons (ex)":"At 5th level and higher, a drunken master wielding an improvised weapon deals an extra 1d8 points of damage instead of 1d4. Improved Feint (Ex): A drunken master who attains 6th level gains Improved Feint as a bonus feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites.","improved grapple (ex)":"A drunken master who attains 7th level gains Improved Grapple as a bonus feat even if he does not meet the prerequisites.","for medicinal purposes (sp)":"At 8th level, a drunken master gains the ability to convert a single alcoholic drink he has ingested into a single potion of cure moderate wounds, as if he had just drunk a dose of the potion. To use this ability, the character must be under the effect of an alcoholic drink (see Drink Like a Demon, above). When he converts one drink of alcohol into one dose of the potion, his ability scores change (+2 to Intelligence and Wisdom, &#8212;2 to Strength or Constitution) as if the duration of the alcohol\'s effect had expired. This ability can be used up to three times per day. It is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.","corkscrew rush (ex)":"A drunken master of 9th level or higher can perform this maneuver, leaping forward and twisting his body in midair as he attempts to head-butt an opponent. When making a charge attack he can, in addition to dealing normal damage, initiate a bull rush (without provoking an attack of opportunity). If the bull rush attempt succeeds, the opponent is stunned unless she makes a Will save (DC 10 + the drunken master\'s class level + the drunken master\'s Wis modifier). However, if the bull rush attempt fails, the drunken master lands prone in front of the opponent.","superior improvised weapons (ex)":"At 9th level and higher, a drunken master wielding an improvised weapon deals an extra 1d12 points of damage instead of 1d8. Breath of Flame (Sp): A 10th-level drunken master can ignite some of the alcohol within his body and spew it forth from his mouth as a free action. This breath of flame deals 3d12 points of fire damage to all within the 20-foot cone, or half damage to those who make a Reflex save (DC 10 + the drunken master\'s class level + the drunken master\'s Con modifier). Each time a drunken master uses breath of flame, it consumes one drink\'s worth of alcohol from within his body, lessening the penalty to his Wisdom and Intelligence scores and reducing the bonus to his Strength or Constitution score (character\'s choice)."},"class skills":["balance","bluff","climb","craft","escape artist","hide","jump","listen","move

If you are proficient with light armor, you can cast infiltrator spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal chance for arcane spell failure. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, an infiltrator wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs the normal chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component. A multiclass infiltrator still incurs the normal chance for arcane spell failure when casting arcane spells received from other classes.","spells":"Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells. To cast an infiltrator spell, you must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell\'s level, so if you have an Intelligence of 10 or lower, you cannot cast these spells. Bonus spells are based on Intelligence, and saving throws against these spells have a DC of 10 + spell level + your Intelligence modifier. When you get 0 spells per day of a given level (for instance 1st-level spells for 1st level), you gain only the bonus spells to which you would be entitled based on your Intelligence score for that spell level. Your spell list appears below. You prepare and cast spells just as a wizard does.","piercing insight (ex)":"Through strenuous training, you learn to more effectively observe the world surrounding you.

","combat anticipation (ex)":"Beginning at 3rd level, your ability to effectively observe the world around you allows you to respond more swiftly to danger. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class, and a +1 bonus on both Reflex saves and initiative checks. These bonuses increase to +2 at 6th level. The bonuses to AC and Reflex saves come in part because you read the intentions of your foe. Thus, you gain those bonuses only against humanoids, monstrous humanoids, and giants. Other creatures are too anatomically different for you to easily anticipate their intentions. This ability functions only when you are wearing light or no armor.","uncanny dodge (ex)":"At 4th level, you cannot be caught flat-footed and react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so.

Armor of any type interferes with a eunuch warlock\'s arcane gestures, which can cause his spells to fail (if those spells have somatic components).","bonus spells":"Similar to bonus spells for high ability scores, for each level of eunuch warlock that a spellcasting character attains, he gains bonus spells to the number of arcane spells per day he normally casts. These bonus spells can be added to whatever levels of spells the eunuch warlock can currently cast, but no more than one can be added to the character\'s highest current spell level. Example: Wieh Wan is a 9th-level wu jen who takes one level in eunuch warlock. He can give himself one bonus 5th-level spell (his highest as a 9th-level wu jen), and one bonus spell in one other level, 0 through 4th.","greater spell focus (ex)":"A eunuch warlock adds +4 to the DC for saving throws against spells in all schools for which he has the Spell Focus feat, instead of the normal +2 bonus granted by that feat. In addition, the eunuch warlock gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks to beat a creature\'s spell resistance with spells from those schools. This additional bonus stacks with the <a href=\\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/spell-penetration--2707/\\">Spell Penetration</a> feat.","mighty spells (ex)":"At 2nd level, and at every even level thereafter, a eunuch warlock can designate one spell he knows that becomes modified as though affected by the <a href=\\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/empower-spell--848/\\">Empower Spell</a> feat. The spell\'s level does not change, and once the spell is chosen it cannot be changed.","leadership":"At 3rd level, a eunuch warlock gains the <a href=\\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/leadership--1740/\\">Leadership</a> feat for free. Eunuch warlocks typically have units of soldiers at their command. If the eunuch warlock already has the Leadership feat, he gain a permanent +2 bonus on his Leadership score for purposes of determining followers, but not cohorts. (Typically, this bonus only negates the -2 penalty the character suffers for a reputation of cruelty.)","new spell level":"When a eunuch warlock reaches 5th level, and again when he reaches 10th level, he gains the ability to cast spells of one level higher than he was previously able to cast. Initially, he can cast 0 spells of this level, but bonus spells (from a high ability score or his eunuch warlock bonus spells) can increase this number. Example: Wieh Wan is a 9th-level wu jen/4th-level eunuch warlock. When he reaches 5th level as a eunuch warlock, he gains the ability to cast 6th-level wu jen spells. He must allocate one of his bonus spells to 6th level in order to cast any 6th-level spells, unless his Intelligence is high enough (22 or higher) to give him a bonus 6th-level spell."},"class skills":["alchemy","bluff","concentration","craft","diplomacy","disguise","forgery","gather information","knowledge (arcana)","profession","scry","spellcraft"]},"323":{"name":"Evangelist","link":"/classes/complete-divine--56/evangelist/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"12","requirements":{"alignment":["as a cleric of the chosen deity"],"skills":["Bluff","Gather Information","Knowledge (religion)","Perform","Sense Motive"],"feats":["Negotiator","Persuasive"]},"skill points":{"base":6,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":0,"fort":0,"ref":0,"will":2,"special":["Great orator (inspire dread or inspire hope)"]},{"level":2,"bab":1,"fort":0,"ref":0,"will":3,"special":["Fast talk"]},{"level":3,"bab":2,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":3,"special":["Great orator (inflame the righteous)"]},{"level":4,"bab":3,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":["Skill mastery"]},{"level":5,"bab":3,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":["Great orator (convert the unfaithful)"]}],"hit die":6,"class features":{"weapon and armor proficiency":"Evangelists gain no weapon or armor proficiencies.","great orator (su)":"An evangelist can inspire, protect, and otherwise improve the situation of his allies simply by speaking clearly and being heard. This ability is similar to the bard\'s bardic music ability (see page 29 of the Player\'s Handbook for a complete description) and, indeed, evangelist levels stack with bard levels to determine the strength of known bard songs. For example, a bard 3/evangelist 5 improves his inspire competence ability, but does not gain any new bard abilities. He could use bardic music to convert the unfaithful, countersong, fascinate, inspire the righteous, inspire courage +2, inspire dread or inspire hope, but would not gain the inspire competence, inspire greatness, or suggestion abilities. Alternately, a bard 7/evangelist 1 would be able to use bardic music to countersong, fascinate, inspire competence, inspire courage +2, inspire dread or inspire hope, and suggestion.

A feral trance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + your Con modifier. While in a trance, you cannot perform certain actions, and afterward you are fatigued. These restrictions are the same as those for the barbarian\'s rage class feature (PH25&#8212;26). If you have the ability to enter a rage, you can do so while in a feral trance, using your increased Constitution score to determine the duration of both effects.<br />At 3rd level, you can use this ability twice per day. ","primal living (ex)":"To maintain your bestial powers, you must live like a wild animal. You must sleep in natural environments, never inside buildings, unless forced by circumstances . Furthermore, you cannot purchase food&#8212;you must obtain it by hunting, gathering, begging, or stealing. Some fists of the forest even give up speech, the use of fire and tools, and all possessions, but such extremes are not required. In any month in which you buy food or voluntarily sleep indoors more than three times, all your fist of the forest class features cease to function until you have spent thirty consecutive days living like an animal once more, or until a fellow Guardian of the Green casts <em>atonement</em> on you.","unarmed damage (ex)":"Your unarmed attacks deal more damage than usual. At 1st level, you deal 1d8 points of damage with each unarmed strike. When you attain 3rd level, this damage increases to 1d10 points. See the monk class feature (PH41). If your unarmed attack already deals this amount of damage, increase the base damage to the next step indicated on the monk class table.","uncanny dodge (ex)":"At 2nd level, you cannot be caught flatfooted, and you react to danger before your senses would normally allow you to do so. See the barbarian class feature (PH26). If you already have uncanny dodge from another class, you instead gain improved uncanny dodge.","untamed strike (su)":"On attaining 2nd level, you can channel the untamed power of nature when you attack. Your unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons; see the monk\'s kistrike class feature (PH41). If your unarmed strikes are already magical, they instead are treated lesser ghost touch weapons. They deal full damage against incorporeal creatures 50% of the time and half damage the rest of the time.","scent (su)":"Beginning at 3rd level, you gain the supernatural ability to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. This ability otherwise functions like the extraordinary ability of the same name (MM314)."},"class skills":["balance","climb","handle animal","intimidate","jump","listen","move silently","sense motive","spot","survival","swim"]},"364":{"name":"Fist of Zuoken","link":"/classes/expanded-psionics-handbook--65/fist-of-zuoken/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"35","requirements":{"bab":4,"skills":["Concentration"],"feats":["Wild Talent"],"special":"Still mind class feature."},"skill points":{"base":4,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":0,"fort":0,"ref":2,"will":2,"special":["Monk abilities"],"power points/day":1,"powers known":1,"maximum power level known":1},{"level":2,"bab":1,"fort":0,"ref":3,"will":3,"special":[""],"power points/day":6,"powers known":2,"maximum power level known":1},{"level":3,"bab":2,"fort":1,"ref":3,"will":3,"special":[""],"power points/day":6,"powers known":3,"maximum power level known":2},{"level":4,"bab":3,"fort":1,"ref":4,"will":4,"special":[""],"power points/day":10,"powers known":4,"maximum power level known":2},{"level":5,"bab":3,"fort":1,"ref":4,"will":4,"special":["Bonus psionic feat"],"power points/day":15,"powers known":5,"maximum power level known":3},{"level":6,"bab":4,"fort":2,"ref":5,"will":5,"special":[""],"power points/day":23,"powers known":6,"maximum power level known":3},{"level":7,"bab":5,"fort":2,"ref":5,"will":5,"special":[""],"power points/day":31,"powers known":7,"maximum power level known":4},{"level":8,"bab":6,"fort":2,"ref":6,"will":6,"special":[""],"power points/day":43,"powers known":8,"maximum power level known":4},{"level":9,"bab":6,"fort":3,"ref":6,"will":6,"special":[""],"power points/day":55,"powers known":9,"maximum power level known":5},{"level":10,"bab":7,"fort":3,"ref":7,"will":7,"special":["Bonus psionic feat"],"power points/day":71,"powers known":10,"maximum power level known":5}],"hit die":6,"class features":{},"class skills":["autohypnosis","concentration","craft","escape artist","hide","jump","knowledge (psionics)","knowledge (religion)","listen","move silently","psicraft","sense motive","spot","tumble"]},"365":{"name":"Flayerspawn Psychic","link":"/classes/complete-psionic--59/flayerspawn-psychic/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"14","requirements":{"skills":["Knowledge (psionics)"],"feats":["Illithid Heritage"],"powers":"Ability to manifest <em>psionic charm</em>.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of rebuking or controlling undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a flux adept, she must decide to which class she adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.","grace through will (ex)":"The simplest lesson of the path of the flux adept is the means to precisely control all of the body\'s muscles. While this is by no means something that can be mastered immediately, the mind and body can be made, in time, to work as one. The character adds half her flux adept level to all Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, and Tumble skill checks.","pheromonic control (ex)":"At 2nd level, the flux adept learns that beauty is more than skin deep&#8212;it lies at least as deep as the glands. Three times per day, the flux adept may create an affect that functions like eagle\'s splendor, as cast by a sorcerer of the flux adept\'s class level. In addition, the flux adept gains an additional +2 bonus on any Charisma-based skill check made against a creature with the scent ability.","thermoregulation (su)":"A 2nd-level flux adept can, at will, vary her skin and blood to cope with extremes of temperature, even when these extremes have magical origins. The flux adept gains a +2 bonus on all saves against fire or cold effects, as well as Fortitude saves made in cold or very hot conditions (<span class=\\"caps\\">DUNGEON</span> MASTER\'S Guide, pages 302-303). At 7th level, the bonus increases to +4, and the flux adept is immune to the effects of cold and hot conditions.","iron stomach (su)":"Beginning at 3rd level, the flux adept may draw nutrients out of any substance: bark, grass, stone, gold, and even ash. The adept gains no benefit against poisons delivered by an attack, but becomes immune to all ingested poisons (<span class=\\"caps\\">DUNGEON</span> MASTER\'S Guide, page 297).","bitter tides (ex)":"The 4th-level flux adept now commands the composition of all fluids produced by glands or ducts of the body, such as tears, sweat, and saliva. She gains the ability to make such fluids acidic, and can do so a number of times per day equal to 3 plus her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). With this ability, the flux adept may either spit a single concentrated bolus of acidic saliva or sweat acid for 10 minutes. The acidic spittle deals 3d6 points of acid damage on a successful ranged touch attack (range increment 10 feet). Her acidic sweat deals 1 point of acid damage per round to any object she touches and wishes to affect. In addition, any creature that hits her with a natural weapon suffers 1 point of acid damage per hit. For each minute that she touches an item (such as ropes or shackles binding her, or a wooden door that blocks her path), her acidic sweat ignores 1 point of the object\'s hardness.","feign death (ex)":"The 5th-level flux adept is able to turn off her metabolism (requiring no food, water, or even air) by entering a deep trance that resembles death. She can remain in this dormant state for up to 24 hours, and shows all the physical signs of death. She may enter this trance as a standard action. Awakening from the trance takes a full round. Upon entering a trance, the flux adept must designate up to three triggers that will awaken her prematurely. A trigger can only be an event that somehow affects the character (such as being touched, slapped, or damaged), and cannot be something tied to the time of day (such as the sun rising or setting). Triggers cannot depend on he character perceiving her surroundings, such as hearing a sound. If none of her triggers are set off during her trance, the flux adept remains in this state for the full 24 hours. After a full 24 hours of rest in this state, the flux adept heals 2d8 damage and 2 points of damage to each ability score. While in this inert state, her body slowly repairs damage it has suffered.","taste of truth (ex)":"At 6th level, the hormones of the body are now so familiar to the flux adept that she can actually read a creature\'s emotions by tasting its infinitesimal hormonal secretions in the air. Against living creatures, the flux adept receives a bonus on all Bluff and Sense Motive checks equal to her flux adept class level. Conditions that would prevent a creature from using the scent ability prevent a flux adept from using this ability.","haste (ex)":"Twice per day as a free action, the 7th-level flux adept may control her adrenaline and muscles to the extent she can act as if she was under the effect of a haste spell, as cast by a sorcerer of her flux adept level.","boiling blood (ex)":"At 8th level, the flux adept has such mastery over her body chemistry that she can cause her hands to bloat with her body\'s primal power. Her hands become over-sized claws that grant her a natural attack. This grants the flux adept two claw attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage plus her Strength modifier.","polyhaemia (su)":"This ability allows the 9th-level flux adept to resynthesize potions in her own blood from those that she has consumed in the last 24 hours. Once synthesized, the potion immediately affects the flux adept as if she had just drunk it. This ability requires a Craft (alchemy) check with a DC equal 20 + double the spell\'s level. For example, a flux adept attempting to duplicate a potion of blur would need to succeed at DC 22 Craft (alchemy) check. The flux adept may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 plus her Constitution modifier (minimum 1 per day). A failed Craft (alchemy) check still consumes a use of the ability. Each use requires a full-round action that provokes an attack of opportunity.","regeneration 1 (ex)":"At 10th level, a flux adept\'s mastery of the immune and repair systems of the body is such that she gains regeneration 1. Cold, electricity, fire, and sonic deal normal damage to a flux adept.

proficiency":"Geomancers gain no weapon or armor proficiencies.","spells per day/spells known":"At each geomancer level, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if he had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which he belonged before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (additional wild shape options, metamagic or item creation feats, or the like). Since the character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a geomancer, the player must decide to which class to add each geomancer level for determining spells per day and spells known.","spell versatility":"At 1st level, the geomancer learns to blend divine and arcane magic. He still acquires and prepares his spells in the normal manner for his individual spellcasting classes. When he casts them, however, he can mix or match spellcasting parameters from any of his classes to gain the maximum possible advantage for any spell with a spell level equal to or less than his spell versatility score. Thus, as a 4th-level geomancer, he can cast any of his 3rd-level or lower sorcerer/wizard spells with no chance of arcane spell failure from armor. (The druidic prohibition against metal armor still applies to druid/geomancers, however, since this stricture stems from a spiritual oath rather than a practical limitation.) The geomancer may use his Wisdom modifier to set the save DC for arcane spells, or his Charisma or Intelligence modifier (whichever he would normally use for arcane spells) to set the save DC for divine spells. If a spell requires either an arcane material component or a divine focus, he may use either. A cleric/geomancer who also has levels of wizard, sorcerer, or bard can spontaneously convert any prepared arcane or divine spell (except a domain spell) of an appropriate level into a cure or inflict spell of equal or lower level, though he must be capable of casting the latter as a cleric.","drift":"The character slowly becomes closer to nature. At each geomancer level, choose a drift from the appropriate stage (see Drift, below).","ley lines":"At 2nd level, the geomancer learns to create magical connections with a specific type of terrain. Choose one of the following terrain types: aquatic, desert, forest, hills, marsh, mountains, or plains. In that terrain, the geomancer\'s effective caster level for all spells increases by +1. At 6th level and again at 10th level, the character may either choose a new terrain in which to receive the benefit (at +1), or increase his effective caster level in a previously chosen terrain by an additional +1."},"class skills":["climb","concentration","craft","diplomacy","handle animal","heal","knowledge (arcana)","knowledge (geography)","knowledge

If the attack deals damage to the target, the victim must make a Will save (DC 10 + ghost-faced killer\'s class level + ghost-faced killer\'s Cha modifier). If the victim succeeds, she is shaken for 1 round per class level of the ghost-faced killer; if she fails, she instantly dies of fear.

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one divine spellcasting class before becoming a gray guard, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.","sacrament of trust":"Upon entering this prestige class, you take a vow of allegiance to your faith beyond that of any ordinary paladin. This vow grants you a measure of freedom to act on your cause\'s behalf without fear of retribution should your duties require you to break your code of conduct. Dishonorable acts still cause you to lose both gray guard and paladin class features until you atone, but this infraction is considered much less severe than it would be for a paladin.","lay on hands (su)":"This ability is identical to the paladin class feature of the same name (PH 44). Levels of gray guard stack with other class levels that grant lay on hands to determine the ability\'s total healing capacity.","debilitating touch (su)":"At 2nd level, you learn to channel your lay on hands ability into a painful touch attack. Many gray guards use debilitating touch during interrogation, since it reduces the target\'s ability to successfully bluff or resist magical effects. Using debilitating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity. An opponent hit by this attack is sickened for 5 rounds. Using this ability costs 5 points of your daily healing allotment. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) negates the effect.","smite evil (su)":"Beginning at 3rd level, you can smite evil once per day. See the paladin class feature (PH 44). At 8th level, you can smite evil one additional time per day. Levels of other classes that grant the smite evil class feature stack for the purpose of determining the extra damage dealt. For example, a 5th-level paladin/5th-level gray guard delivering a smite evil attack adds 10 points of damage to the attack.","justice blade (su)":"By 4th level, you have learned that suffering and injustice are not the exclusive province of evil. You can use your smite evil ability to instead punish creatures of chaotic alignment. Using this ability expends one daily use of your smite evil class feature and works identically in all other ways, but its effect applies only to chaotic targets. Whenever you choose to smite an opponent, you must declare whether you are using this ability to smite evil or chaos. If you accidentally smite a creature of an alignment other than that declared, the smite has no effect but the ability is still used up.","devastating touch (su)":"When you attain 5th level, your deity shows its approval of your grim work. From this point on, you can use your lay on hands ability to make a touch attack that harms your enemies. Using devastating touch does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You decide how many points of your daily healing allotment to expend after successfully touching a creature: Each point expended deals 1 point of damage to the target. A nonevil creature is allowed a Will save (DC 10 + your gray guard level + your Cha modifier) to halve the amount of damage dealt.","unbound justice (ex)":"At 7th level, unrestricted by your code of honor, you can employ unorthodox methods that are all the more effective because they\'re unexpected. You add half your gray guard level (round down) as a competence bonus on Bluff, Disguise, and Intimidate skill checks.","sacrament of the true faith":"At 10th level, you gain your order\'s full confidence. You are granted the freedom to act on behalf of your faith as you deem necessary. Thus, you never risk losing your class abilities in the pursuit of a just cause and never need to atone for violating your code of conduct. This trust does not grant you the freedom to act as violently or immorally as you wish, however. Release from your code of conduct depends on your acting as an exemplar of your order\'s ideals. If you violate this trust by habitually acting in an immoral or corrupt manner, the leaders or deity of your faith might revoke their blessing and banish you from the ranks of the faithful.","code of conduct":"As a gray guard, you are held to the same code of conduct as a paladin. You must be of lawful good alignment and must never willingly commit an evil act. You must also pledge to respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, cheating, using poison, and the like), aid the needy, and punish those who harm the innocent. If you contravene your code of conduct, you must atone for the transgression or lose all class abilities from both gray guard and paladin levels. As you advance in the prestige class, this code becomes more flexible. However, its tenets still apply: You can never break your code without good reason."},"class skills":["bluff","concentration","disguise","forgery","handle animal","heal","intimidate","knowledge (local)","knowledge (nobility and royalty)","knowledge (religion)","ride","sense motive"]},"400":{"name":"Gray Hand Enforcer","link":"/classes/city-of-splendors-waterdeep--16/gray-hand-enforcer/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"7","requirements":{"bab":7,"alignment":["any nonevil"],"skills":["Intimidate"],"feats":["Endurance","Toughness","Power Attack","Empower Spell"],"special":"Ability to cast 4th-level spells (<em>or</em> <span class=\\"caps\\">BAB</span> requirement), Must be a member of the Gray Hands."},"skill points":{"base":2,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":1,"fort":2,"ref":0,"will":0,"special":["Damage reduction 1/&#8212;","Gray Hand token"],"spellcasting":""},{"level":2,"bab":2,"fort":3,"ref":0,"will":0,"special":["Dragonward strike 1/day"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":3,"bab":3,"fort":3,"ref":1,"will":1,"special":["Damage reduction 2/&#8212;"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":4,"bab":4,"fort":4,"ref":1,"will":1,"special":["Spell resistance 5 + character level","dragonward strike 2/day"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":5,"bab":5,"fort":4,"ref":1,"will":1,"special":["Damage reduction 3/&#8212;","Lords\' boon"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"}],"hit die":10,"class features":{"weapon and armor proficiency":"Gray Hand enforcers gain no proficiency with any weapons, armor, or shields.","spellcasting":"A Gray Hand enforcer continues training in magic.

A creature with the improved grab ability must move into the mystic\'s space to grapple him, since it cannot pull the mystic into its space. No spell or other effect can force the mystic to move. If he becomes frightened or panicked, he suffers the full effect of the fear but does not run away. He cannot move, even to make a 5-foot step, while this ability is in effect. Root the mountain lasts for 1 round per level, but the mystic can end it at any time.","<em>riddle of interaction</em> (sp)":"A 4th-level henshin mystic can use <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/charm-monster--2533/\\">charm monster</a> as a spell-like ability three times per day, with a caster level equal to his henshin mystic level and a saving throw DC equal to 14 + his Charisma modifier.

The unarmed strike damage from such an attack can deal damage to a creature with damage reduction as if the blow were made with a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus. At 8th level, a mystic\'s unarmed strike can deal damage against creatures with damage reduction as if it were made with a weapon with a +2 enhancement bonus.

","blindsight (ex)":"At 6th level, a henshin mystic gains the ability to perfectly sense his surroundings without relying on sight. This ability makes invisibility and darkness (even magical darkness) irrelevant to the mystic (though he still can\'t detect ethereal creatures). This ability operates out to a range of 30 feet. The mystic cannot distinguish color or visual contrast with blindsight, and thus cannot read. When using blindsight (and not regular vision), the mystic is unaffected by gaze attacks and is not hampered by blindness. Deafness or silence does not hamper the mystic\'s blindsight, since it relies on extraordinary senses, not on sound.","hitsu-do (su)":"A 6th-level mystic gains the ability to cause his hands, eyes, and weapons to light up with flame once per day, for a duration of 2 rounds per mystic level. Each of the mystic\'s melee attacks deals an extra 1d6 points of damage per attack. The mystic can extinguish the flames before the expiration of the effect\'s duration, but cannot then use the power again that day.","<em>riddle of flame</em> (sp)":"a henshin mystic of 7th level or higher can use <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fire-shield--2610/\\">fire shield</a> as a spell-like ability once per day, with a caster level equal to his henshin mystic level. in addition to the defensive benefits of the spell, the mystic\'s unarmed attacks deal additional cold damage (if the <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fire-shield--2610/\\">fire shield</a> protects against fire-based attacks) or fire damage (if the <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fire-shield--2610/\\">fire shield</a> protects against cold-based attacks) equal to 1d6 points +1 point per level of the mystic. this extra damage does not stack with the hitsu-do ability.","timeless body (ex)":"After attaining 8th level, a henshin mystic no longer suffers ability penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. (Any penalties he may already have suffered remain in place.) Bonuses still accrue, and the mystic still dies of old age when his time is up. ","walk through the mountains (su)":"At 9th level or higher, a henshin mystic can assume an ethereal state for 2 rounds per level per day, as per the spell <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/etherealness--2810/\\">etherealness</a>. The mystic may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day as long as the total number of rounds spent ethereal does not exceed twice his level. ","riddle of invulnerability (su)":"A 10th-level henshin mystic gains damage reduction of 20/+1. This means that the mystic ignores (instantly regenerates) the first 20 points of damage from any attack unless the damage is dealt by a weapon with a +1 enhancement bonus (or better), by a spell, or by a form of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, sonic)."},"class skills":["balance","climb","concentration","craft","diplomacy","escape artist","heal","jump","knowledge","knowledge (arcana)","knowledge (architecture and engineering)","knowledge (dungeoneering)","knowledge (geography)","knowledge (history)","knowledge (local)","knowledge (nature)","knowledge (nobility and royalty)","knowledge (psionics)","knowledge (religion)","knowledge (the planes)","listen","perform","profession","scry","spellcraft","swim","tumble"]},"432":{"name":"Hexblade","link":"/classes/complete-warrior--61/hexblade/","isPrestige":false,"bookId":"16","skill points":{"base":2,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":1,"fort":0,"ref":0,"will":2,"special":["Hexblade\'s curse 1/day"],"1st":"","2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":2,"bab":2,"fort":0,"ref":0,"will":3,"special":["Arcane resistance"],"1st":"","2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":3,"bab":3,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":3,"special":["Mettle"],"1st":"","2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":4,"bab":4,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":["Summon familiar"],"1st":0,"2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":5,"bab":5,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":["Bonus feat","hexblade\'s curse 2/day"],"1st":0,"2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":6,"bab":6,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":5,"special":[""],"1st":1,"2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":7,"bab":7,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":5,"special":["Greater hexblade\'s curse"],"1st":1,"2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":8,"bab":8,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":6,"special":[""],"1st":1,"2nd":0,"3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":9,"bab":9,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":6,"special":["Hexblade\'s curse 3/day"],"1st":1,"2nd":0,"3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":10,"bab":10,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":7,"special":["Bonus feat"],"1st":1,"2nd":1,"3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":11,"bab":11,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":7,"special":[""],"1st":1,"2nd":1,"3rd":0,"4th":""},{"level":12,"bab":12,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":8,"special":["Aura of unlucky 1/day"],"1st":1,"2nd":1,"3rd":1,"4th":""},{"level":13,"bab":13,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":8,"special":["Hexblade\'s curse 4/day"],"1st":1,"2nd":1,"3rd":1,"4th":""},{"level":14,"bab":14,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":9,"special":[""],"1st":2,"2nd":1,"3rd":1,"4th":0},{"level":15,"bab":15,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":9,"special":["Bonus Feat"],"1st":2,"2nd":1,"3rd":1,"4th":1},{"level":16,"bab":16,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":10,"special":["Aura of unlucky 2/day"],"1st":2,"2nd":2,"3rd":1,"4th":1},{"level":17,"bab":17,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":10,"special":["Hexblade\'s curse 5/day"],"1st":2,"2nd":2,"3rd":2,"4th":1},{"level":18,"bab":18,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":11,"special":[""],"1st":3,"2nd":2,"3rd":2,"4th":1},{"level":19,"bab":19,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":11,"special":["Dire hexblade\'s curse"],"1st":3,"2nd":3,"3rd":3,"4th":2},{"level":20,"bab":20,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":12,"special":["Aura of unlucky 3/day","bonus feat"],"1st":3,"2nd":3,"3rd":3,"4th":3}],"hit die":10,"starting gold":10,"class features":{"weapon and armor proficiency":"Hexblades are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor but not with shields.

However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a hexblade wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (and most do). A multiclass hexblade still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells derived from other classes.","hexblade\'s curse (su)":"Once per day, as a free action, a hexblade can unleash a curse upon a foe.

A bard or sorcerer who becomes an incantatrix must still choose a prohibited school to gain the benefits of specialization.","send away (ex)":"The incantatrix gains a +2 bonus to all dispel checks and caster level checks to harm, banish, or overcome the spell resistance of outsiders. This includes dispel checks to dispel a <em>summon monster</em> spell.","bonus metamagic feat":"At 1st, 5th, and 10th level, the incantatrix may select a bonus metamagic feat.","see ethereal (su)":"Once per day, an incantatrix of 3rd level or greater can see into the Ethereal Plane for a number of rounds equal to her class level. She can see ethereal creatures up to 60 feet away, although they appear gray and insubstantial (as objects on the Material Plane appear to ethereal creatures). This does not give her any additional ability to attack ethereal creatures, but she can utilize spells and effects that affect ethereal creatures (such as force effects and abjurations) normally, so she could cast a magic missile at an ethereal creature.","strike ethereal (su)":"Beginning at 4th level, the incantatrix can alter her spells so they strike ethereal targets that she can see. Altering a spell in this way works similar to a sorcerer using a metamagic feat &#8212; spells with a casting time of one action become full-round spells, and spells with a longer casting time take an extra full-round action to cast. The altered spell takes effect on the Ethereal Plane instead of the Material Plane.","hardy spirit (su)":"At 6th level, the incantatrix becomes immune to death effects and energy drain attacks.","instant metamagic (su)":"Once per day, the 7th-level incantatrix can use a single metamagic effect of any metamagic feat she knows on a spell without preparing it beforehand (if a wizard) or increasing its casting time (if a sorcerer or bard). The wizard\'s prepared spell works as if prepared with the metamagic feat except it uses the same spell slot. A sorcerer or bard\'s spell is cast without the adjustment to the casting time but works as if cast with the metamagic feat. A 9th-level incantatrix can use this power twice per day.","improved metamagic (su)":"At 8th level, the incantatrix has mastered metamagic to such an extent that whenever she uses a metamagic feat, the feat\'s level increase upon a spell is reduced by one (this can\'t reduce an increase to less than one level, or less than zero levels if the increase is already +0). For example, an incantatrix wizard could prepare a quickened <em>fireball</em> as a 6th-level spell instead of a 7th-level spell.","drain item (sp)":"An incantatrix of 10th level can drain a charge from a charged magic item, using the magic to heal herself. If the item drained is a staff, the spell level is that of the lowest-level spell that uses a single charge. She gains 1d6 hit points per spell level of the charge drained. If the incantatrix has reached her maximum hit points, any additional hit points acquired are temporary hit points (maximum +20) that disappear after 10 minutes. A creature gets to make a Will save (DC 10) to prevent one of its held or carried items from being drained."},"class skills":["alchemy","concentration","craft","heal","intimidate","knowledge

He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a jester must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell\'s level. The save DC for the jester\'s spells is 10 + the spell\'s level + the jester\'s Charisma modifier.","jester\'s audacity":"The jester\'s natural talent for performance, his often outrageous dress, and his seemingly lackadaisical attitude throws his opponents off guard in combat. Even a jester armed with a vicious-looking weapon cuts a comedic figure that many warriors have trouble taking seriously.","jester\'s performance":"The jester is the master of the verbal put down, the hilarious joke, or the savage verbal lashing. His words can inspire dread and outrage in his enemies or confidence and comfort in his friends. Once per day per jester level, the jester can use his wit to produce magical effects in those around him. The jester must have at least 1 rank in Perform (comedy) to use these abilities, and many of them rely on the use of that skill to establish their save DCs and other effects. The jester must share a language and be able to speak to the target or targets of his performance abilities unless otherwise noted in the specific ability\'s description.","bonus feats":"A jester learns a variety of juggling tricks to entertain his audience. As a result, he develops the reflexes and timing needed to knock fast moving objects out of the air. At 2nd level, a jester with 5 or more ranks in Perform (comedy) gains Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat.<br />At 6th level, a jester with 9 or more ranks in Perform (comedy) gains Snatch Arrows as a bonus feat. His reflexes and timing improve to the point that he can catch deadly missiles rather than merely knock them aside.","bone rattler":"At l0th-level, the jester\'s antics are so vexing that even the normally implacable undead fall victim to them. The jester\'s mind-affecting jester\'s performance abilities function as normal against undead that possess intelligence scores, although undead creatures gain a +2 bonus on their saves against such abilities.

While studying the victim, you can undertake other actions so long as your attention stays focused on the target and the target does not detect you or recognize you as an enemy. If the victim of such an attack fails a Fortitude save (DC 20 + your Int modifier) against the kill effect, it dies. If the saving throw fails against the paralysis effect, the target is rendered helpless and unable to act for 1d6+10 rounds.

From this lifewell, the lifedrinker draws the power needed to use their abilities. A lifedrinker gains lifewell points by bestowing negative levels and by dealing Constitution drain.

The lifewell of a lifedrinker can hold a maximum of 3 points per lifedrinker level. Lifewell points gained when the lifewell is already full are wasted. ","invigorate (ex)":"A lifedrinker can spend 1 lifewell point to gain 1d6 temporary hit points. These hit points last 24 hours, and while they do not stack with those granted by other sources of temporary hit points, they do stack with more hit points gained from the invigorate ability, so a lifedrinker may spend multiple lifewell points to gain more temporary hit points.

For every 2 lifewell points devoted to the spell boost, the spell\'s effective level is treated as one higher for purposes of save DC and other effects. For example, if a lifedrinker spends 4 lifewell points to boost a <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\\"><em>fireball</em></a> spell, the spell is treated as a 5th-level spell when calculating the Reflex save DC, and the boosted <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fireball--2612/\\"><em>fireball</em></a> can penetrate a <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/globe-of-invulnerability-lesser--2325/\\"><em>minor globe of invulnerability</em></a>, which a 3rd-level fireball cannot.

The ally automatically serves the lifedrinker for 24 hours. ","boost defenses (ex)":"At 5th level, a lifedrinker can spend 8 lifewell points to add +2 to its natural armor bonus and turn resistance, add +10 to its cold resistance and electricity resistance, and increase its damage reduction to 20/+2. The effect lasts for 24 hours.","spell boost (maximize) (ex)":"If a lifedrinker of 6th level or higher casts spells, it can spend 6 lifewell points to maximize a spell as if using the Maximize Spell feat.

The special attack is maximized for one use only. A lifedrinker using this ability to maximize its greater blood drain ability, for example, would deal 6 points of Constitution drain. A lifedrinker could also use this ability to summon a maximum number of creatures using the children of the night ability it gains as a vampire. Some lifedrinkers might have other special abilities that they can boost in a similar fashion. ","spell boost (quicken) (ex)":"If a lifedrinker of 8th level or higher casts spells, it can spend 8 lifewell points to quicken one of its spells, as if using the Quicken Spell feat.

","greater invigorate (ex)":"Whenever a 9th-level lifedrinker uses its invigorate ability, it gains a +1 enchantment bonus to Strength for each lifewell point spent. If multiple lifewell points are spent at the same time, the bonus is correspondingly larger. A lifedrinker that spends 10 lifewell points all at once on invigorate gains 10d6 temporary hit points and +10 enchantment bonus to Strength. But if the lifedrinker spends 5 lifewell points in one round and 5 more points in the next, it has 10d6 temporary hit points but only +5 enchantment bonus to Strength. The bonus to Strength lasts for 24 hours. ","blood revel (ex)":"Once a 10th-level lifedrinker drains any blood from a victim, it can choose to enter a state called a blood revel as a free action at the beginning of its next turn and remain in that state for 10 rounds. In this state, the lifedrinker gains a +4 profane bonus to Strength, its damage reduction increases to 25/+3, its fast healing increases to 10 hit points per round, and it may ignore its weakness toward garlic, mirrors, holy symbols, and running water, as well as its vulnerability to sunlight."},"class skills":["bluff","hide","knowledge (arcana)","listen","move silently","profession","search","sense motive","spellcraft","spot"]},"521":{"name":"Lightbringer","link":"/classes/expedition-to-castle-ravenloft--102/lightbringer/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"36","requirements":{"associated classes":"Any.","associated skills":["concentration"," gather information"," heal"," knowledge (history)"," knowledge (local)"," knowledge (religion)"],"dues":"The initiation fee is a one-time payment of 100 gp, donated to the affiliated temple housing the local Lightbringers chapter.

You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a lord of tides, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.","locate potable water (su)":"This ability is similar to the <a href=\\"/spells/sandstorm--85/locate-water--3150/\\">locate water</a> spell (see page 117), but in addition to determining the size and distance of water bodies, you can tell whether the water is drinkable. If it is not drinkable, you can sense the reason, such as salt, poison, infectious organisms, or magical fouling. The ability takes a fullround action to initiate and lasts for 10 minutes.","heat endurance":"You gain Heat Endurance as a bonus feat. If you already have the Heat Endurance feat, you instead gain Improved Heat Endurance. ","release the water within (sp)":"Starting at 2nd level, you can painfully extract water from living creatures once per day, creating a puddle at their feet. When you use this ability, a living creature you target within 30 feet must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + lord of tides level + your Wis modifier) or take 1d8 points of dessication damage per lord of tides level. This dessication damage cannot be healed (even with cure magic) until the creature drinks at least 1 quart of water. Creatures that fail their saves take damage and are fatigued until they drink a quart of water. If you kill a living creature with this ability, the puddle of water around the body animates 1 round later into a water mephit, which you can control for up to 1 minute per lord of tides class level. After the duration has expired, the mephit collapses back into a puddle of inanimate water. At 4th, 7th, and 10th level, you gain more daily uses of this ability.","burrow (ex)":"On attaining 3rd level, you gain a burrow speed of 5 feet. This ability allows movement only through relatively soft materials, such as earth and sand. Many dungeon floors and buildings are made of stone, which you cannot pass through with this ability. You do not gain any special ability to avoid suffocation. ","summon elemental (sp)":"Beginning at 6th level, you are able to summon a Large elemental once per day, which must have the water subtype. The ability is otherwise identical to the <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/summon-monster-vi--2446/\\">summon monster VI</a> spell (see page 287 of the Player\'s Handbook). When you reach 8th level, this ability improves: You can summon either an elder elemental once per day or a Large elemental three times per day, which can have the water or fire subtype. The ability is otherwise identical to the <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/summon-monster-ix--2449/\\">summon monster IX</a> spell (see page 288 of the Player\'s Handbook). Your effective caster level for this ability is equal to 10 + your lord of tides class level. ","elemental jaunt (su)":"At 9th level you gain the ability to shift to an elemental plane for short times, once per day as a standard action. This ability is similar to the <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/plane-shift--2423/\\">plane shift</a> spell (see page 262 of the Player\'s Handbook), but you and up to eight willing creatures remain on the elemental plane for up to 1 minute per lord of tides class level. This ability grants no protection against the environmental hazards of the chosen plane. ","elemental portal (su)":"This ability is the pinnacle of the art embodied in the lord of tides class. When you reach 10th level, you can create a limited-use portal between the Material Plane and a location of your choice that you have visited on any elemental plane. The portal appears as a two-dimensional circular aperture with a radius of 10 feet, which resembles an eddy of colored water standing vertically in the air. The color of the water depends on the plane to which the portal connects: pale blue for the Elemental Plane of Air, green for the Elemental Plane of Earth, red for the Elemental Plane of Fire, and deep blue for the Elemental Plane of Water. The portal you bring into being is usable twice per day and is keyed to a special object you make as part of the creation process. The possessor of this portal key can activate the portal and pass through it as a standard action. Any other creatures wishing to pass through must do so within 1 round after the key-holder opens it. Once the portal is open, touching or passing through it instantly transports a creature to the elemental plane, provided the creature fits within its physical dimensions. The portal grants no protection against the environmental hazards of that plane. A solid object at the destination point prevents the portal\'s operation, but not the presence of a creature (the traveler is instead transported to the closest possible space to the original destination). Unattended objects cannot pass through a portal, but a traveler can carry up to 850 pounds of equipment."},"class skills":["concentration","craft","knowledge (geography)","knowledge

For instance, he can use sustained force for 2 rounds, then switch to combat maneuver, then return to using sustained force. The spell or spell-like ability ends after the first use of the violent thrust version, however, or if the master of the unseen hand is unable to maintain concentration.","telekinetic wielder (ex)":"A master of the unseen hand develops the ability to wield weapons with his telekinetic power. By maintaining concentration on the combat maneuver version of telekinesis, a master of the unseen hand of 2nd level or higher can make a single attack with an unattended weapon or one he is holding, moving the weapon up to 20 feet before the attack. Resolve the attack as normal, except that the weapon\'s movement doesn\'t provoke attacks of opportunity. The master of the unseen hand\'s base attack bonus on this attempt is equal to his caster level plus his Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer or a creature with the telekinesis supernatural or spell-like ability). Any weapon-related feats the master of the unseen hand has (such as <a href=\\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/weapon-focus--3105/\\">Weapon Focus</a> and <a href=\\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/power-attack--2208/\\">Power Attack</a>) do not apply when he\'s telekinetically wielding a weapon.","sustained concentration (ex)":"At 2nd level, a master of the unseen hand becomes adept at moving and fighting while maintaining his telekinesis ability. It only takes a move action, not a standard action, to use the sustained force version of telekinesis (or simply to maintain concentration so the ability doesn\'t end). The master of the unseen hand can even cast another spell while maintaining concentration on telekinesis, but doing so requires a successful Concentration check as if the caster were distracted by a nondamaging spell (Concentration check DC equal to the save DC of telekinesis). It still takes a standard action to use the combat maneuver or violent thrust versions of the ability, however.","full attack telekinesis (ex)":"At 3rd level, a master of the unseen hand is as skilled in telekinetic combat as a fighter is with melee combat. When using the combat maneuver version of telekinesis or wielding a weapon telekinetically, the master of the unseen hand can make a full attack, potentially attacking, bull rushing, disarming, grappling, or tripping more than once per round. Just as with nontelekinetic attacks, the master of the unseen hand gains an additional attack for every 5 points of base attack bonus above +1 (using caster level for base attack bonus as described in the telekinesis spell description).","improved violent thrust (ex)":"At 4th level, a master of the unseen hand\'s violent thrust version of telekinesis becomes more effective. He uses his caster level in place of his base attack bonus when making the attack roll, and he uses his Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer or a creature with the telekinesis supernatural or spell-like ability) as a bonus on damage rolls if he hurls weapons at the target. Finally, using a violent thrust no longer ends the telekinesis effect, but the master of the unseen hand can\'t make another violent thrust for 1d4 rounds. ","telekinetic flight (ex)":"A master of the unseen hand of 4th level or higher can use the sustained force version of telekinesis to lift himself and willing creatures into the air. With a move action, the master of the unseen hand can move 20 feet with perfect maneuverability and can move willing creatures as well. The master of the unseen hand doesn\'t have to move all the creatures he\'s lifting in the same direction, but any lifted creatures plummet to the ground if they move more than 40 feet from the master of the unseen hand. The master of the unseen hand can lift one Medium or smaller creature (carrying up to its maximum load) per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. Unlike the form of flight granted by the <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/fly--2816/\\"><em>fly</em></a> spell, telekinetic flight ends immediately and abruptly if disrupted by dispel magic or a lapse in the master of the unseen hand\'s concentration. Without telekinesis to support them, creatures fall to the ground immediately, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen (maximum 20d6).","fling skyward (ex)":"Rather than hurling a creature toward another target, a 5th-level master of the unseen hand can use the violent thrust version of telekinesis to hurl a creature straight up. A target is allowed a Will save (and spell resistance) to negate the effect. The master of the unseen hand can lift a creature into the air a maximum distance of 10 feet per caster level. At the beginning of the character\'s next action, the creature falls to the ground, taking 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet fallen. Unlike other times when a master of the unseen hand uses the violent thrust version of telekinesis, flinging a foe skyward immediately ends the telekinesis effect."},"class

","break away (ex)":"Skilled as she is, a nightsong infiltrator knows the sensibility of falling back from an unwinnable fight. Starting at 3rd level, she gains a +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class in any round during which she does nothing but move. ","trackless step (ex)":"Beginning at 3rd level, a nightsong infiltrator cannot be tracked in natural surroundings. See the druid class feature, page 36 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>.","detect magic (sp)":"Starting at 4th level, a nightsong infiltrator can use <em>detect magic</em> at will. See the spell, page 219 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>.","teamwork sneak attack (ex)":"Beginning at 4th level, a nightsong infiltrator deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. Any ally of the infiltrator who is also flanking the infiltrator\'s opponent deals this extra damage as well. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 8th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>. If a nightsong infiltrator or her ally gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.","defensive roll (ex)":"Starting at 5th level, a nightsong infiltrator can attempt to roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. See the rogue class feature, page 51 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>.","grant move action (ex)":"Starting at 5th level, a nightsong infiltrator can direct and motivate her allies to act immediately. Once per day, as a standard action, she can grant an extra move action to any or all of her allies within 30 feet (but not herself). Each of the affected allies takes this extra move action immediately, acting in their current initiative order. This extra action does not affect the allies\' initiative count; the round continues normally after the infiltrator\'s turn is over.","improved evasion (ex)":"If a nightsong infiltrator of 6th level or higher is exposed to any effect that normally allows her to attempt a Reflex saving throw for half damage, she takes no damage with a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.","skill mastery (ex)":"At 6th level, a nightsong infiltrator has become so confident in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. When making a Climb, Disable Device, Open Lock, or Search check, she can take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. ","specialized tools (ex)":"After studying an area (see teamwork infiltration, above), a nightsong infiltrator of 6th level or higher can prepare a special tool for a job. Doing this requires 1 hour, a DC 15 Craft check (the specific type of Craft specialty required is up to the DM; blacksmithing, leatherworking, or woodworking are all likely candidates), and a set of artisan\'s tools for the Craft skill in question.","hide in plain sight (ex)":"A 10th-level nightsong infiltrator can can use the Hide skill in natural terrain even while being observed.

proficiency. However, they gain proficiency in certain exotic weapons as they advance in level. A ninja spy who wears medium or heavy armor cannot use the following special class features: slow fall, evasion, acrobatics, water walk, and abundant step.","exotic weapon":"At 1st level, and again at 3rd level, 6th level, and 9th level, a ninja spy gains a free <a href=\\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/exotic-weapon-proficiency--985/\\">Exotic Weapon Proficiency</a>. This proficiency must be chosen with one of the following weapons: blowgun, chain, chijiriki, fukimi-bari, hand crossbow, kusari-gama, nekode, ninja-to, shikomi-zue, shuriken, spiked chain, or war fan.","<em>ki</em> breath (ex)":"A ninja spy learns to focus his <em>ki</em> to increase his ability to hold his breath. A ninja adds his ninja level to his Constitution check roll to continue holding his breath (see The Drowning Rule in the <span class=\\"caps\\">DUNGEON</span> MASTER\'s Guide).","poison use":"Ninja spies are trained in the use of poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying poison to a blade.","slow fall (ex)":"At 2nd level, a ninja spy within arm\'s reach of a wall can use the wall to slow his descent. The ninja takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. His ability to slow his fall (that is, to reduce the effective height of the fall when next to a wall) improves with his level until, at 6th level, the ninja can use a nearby wall to slow his descent and fall up to 50 feet without harm.","improved evasion (ex)":"At 2nd level and above, a ninja spy can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If the ninja makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Even if he fails his saving throw, he takes only half damage from the attack. The ninja can only use improved evasion if he is wearing light armor or no armor.","sneak attack (ex)":"If a ninja spy can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Any time the ninja\'s target would be denied her Dexterity bonus to AC (whether she actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the ninja flanks the target, the ninja\'s attack deals extra damage. The extra damage is +1d6 at 2nd level and an additional 1d6 every three levels thereafter. This extra damage stacks with any extra sneak attack damage the character already deals. Thus, a 7th-level rogue/5th-level ninja deals +6d6 damage with a sneak attack: +4d6 from his rogue levels and +2d6 from his ninja levels.","acrobatics (su)":"A 3rd-level ninja spy gains a +10 competence bonus on Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble checks. At 7th level, this bonus increases to +20. In addition, a ninja can always choose to take 10 on a Balance, Climb, Jump, or Tumble check, even when circumstances would normally prevent him from doing so.","leap of the clouds (su)":"A 3rd-level ninja spy\'s jumping distance (vertical or horizontal) is not limited according to his height.","hide in plain sight (su)":"A 4th-level ninja spy can use the Hide skill even while being observed. As long as he is within 10 feet of some sort of shadow, a ninja spy can hide himself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. A ninja spy cannot, however, hide in his own shadow.","water walk (su)":"A ninja spy of 5th level or higher can use water walk to walk on any liquid as if it were firm ground. The ninja must concentrate (as a standard action) to perform this ability, and thus can only take a single move or move-equivalent action each round while water walking. The effect lasts for 1 round per ninja level.","thousand faces (su)":"At 7th level, a ninja spy gains the ability to change his appearance at will, as if using the spell <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/alter-self--2774/\\"><em>alter self</em></a>.","poison immunity (su)":"A ninja spy of 8th level or higher is immune to all poisons.","slippery mind (ex)":"At 9th level, a ninja spy gains the ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel him. If a ninja with slippery mind is affected by a spell and fails his saving throw, he can attempt his saving throw again in the next round. He only gets this one extra chance to succeed at his saving throw.","abundant step (sp)":"A ninja spy of 10th level can slip magically between spaces, as per the spell <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dimension-door--2388/\\"><em>dimension door</em></a>, once per day.

By making a favor check, the noble can call upon contacts to gain important information without going through the time and trouble of a Gather Information check. Favors can also be used to acquire the loan of equipment or documents from influential acquaintances.","inspire confidence":"beginning at 2nd level, a noble can use oratory to inspire confidence in allies, bolstering them and improving their chances of success. An ally must listen to and observe the noble for a full round for the inspiration to take hold. The effects last for 5 rounds. The noble can inspire a number of allies equal to half his noble levels, rounded up.","coordinate":"A noble has a knack fo rgetting people to work together. When the noble can aid others and give directions, he provides a bonus to the task at hand by making an aid another check. This bonus is in addition to the normal aid another bonus of +2, and it increases as the noble gains levels. Therefore, the noble provides a total of +3 bonus at 4th level (+2 aid another bonus, +1 cooperation bonus), a +4 bonus at 8th level, and so on.","inspire greatness":"Beginning at 11th level, a noble can inspire greatness in an ally, granting extra fighting capability. This works similar to inspire confidence, except it affects but a single ally. An ally inspired with greatness gains +2d6 temporary hit points, a +2 competence bonus on attacks, and a +2 moral bonus on saving throws. The effect last for 5 rounds.

He becomes able to travel at a speed of 10 feet through muscular control taught to all novice osteomancers (he may not run). The osteomancer may now fit in minute spaces and crawl under barriers, with one important caveat: the osteomancer must at all times take care to protect his organs, making sure they are not squashed or crushed. For simplicity\'s sake, assume the osteomancer cannot travel through any space smaller than 6 inches in diameter.","immunity to disease (ex)":"Due to their phenomenal understanding of bone and the role it plays in the immune system, osteomancers are immune to disease, including supernatural and magical diseases.","skeletal shift (ex)":"As a standard action, 2nd-level osteomancers can shift the bone structure of their limbs and face (including teeth) to appear as a different person, at will. This ability grants a +3 bonus on Disguise checks.","bone spurs (su)":"The 3rd-level osteomancer may, as a free action, cause portions of his skeleton to break his skin and protrude, causing him no damage or disability whatsoever. The protruding bones act as armor spikes and spiked gauntlets. The osteomancer is automatically proficient in the weapons forged directly from his own skeleton, but not the normal weapons of the same type. Note that while normal bone is far more fragile than any forged weapon, the osteomancer\'s supernatural skill causes his exposed bones to have the strength of steel. He may use this ability at will. As natural weapons, the osteomancer\'s bone spurs cannot be sundered.","unnerve (su)":"As an extension of the above ability, an osteomancer may sculpt his protruding bone into terrifying shapes, such as sinister leering faces. Creatures within 30 feet of the osteomancer attempting to strike or otherwise directly attack the osteomancer, even with a targeted spell, must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + osteomancer level + Charisma modifier). If the save succeeds, the opponent is unaffected and immune to that particular osteomancer\'s unnerve effect for 24 hours. If the save fails, the opponent suffers a -2 penalty on every attack roll against the osteomancer for the next 24 hours. A creature only has to make one save against a particular osteomancer per 24 hour period. This is a mind-affecting, fear effect.","enlarge/reduce (sp)":"Beginning at 4th level, once per day, the osteomancer may cast enlarge person or reduce person on himself as cast by a sorcerer of the osteomancer\'s class level. He gains one daily use of each spell.","iron bones (su)":"A 4th-level osteomancer\'s bone spurs act as cold iron weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.","seize the core (su)":"Once per day, the 5th-level osteomancer can take temporary control of the skeletons of his opponents, paralyzing them. He can affect up to one creature per osteomancer level within 60 feet, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. Each subject is allowed a Fortitude save (DC 10 + osteomancer level + Charisma modifier). Creatures without skeletons (such as oozes) are not affected. Subjects affected by this ability are held immobile as though paralyzed. As this ability targets the bone structure of a being, rather than its mind, corporeal undead are subject to its effect. A winged creature affected by this ability cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer cannot swim and might drown. Creatures immune to paralysis are not immune to this effect.","silver bones (su)":"A 5th-level osteomancer\'s bone spurs act as both silver and cold iron weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.","aligned bones (su)":"At 6th level, an osteomancer\'s bone spurs take on any nonneutral alignment the character has (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. For example, a lawful neutral osteomancer\'s bone spurs act as lawful weapons. A wholly neutral osteomancer must choose for his bone spurs to be chaotic, evil, good, or lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Once chosen, this alignment component cannot be changed.","adamantine bones (su)":"A 7th-level osteomancer\'s bone spurs act as adamantine, cold iron, and silver weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.","sap life (su)":"As a touch attack, an 8th-level osteomancer can cause a malaise to settle into the core of an opponent\'s bones. This effect deals 2d4 points of Strength damage unless the opponent makes a Fortitude save (DC 10 + osteomancer level + Charisma modifier). The osteomancer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 plus his Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This ability can only affect living creatures with a skeleton.","wield the core (su)":"At 9th level, the osteomancer can telepathically control the physical actions of any creature with a skeleton. The target creature must be within 30 feet, and is allowed a Fortitude save (DC 10 + osteomancer level + Charisma modifier) to negate the effect. On a failed save, the osteomancer can control the movements of the subject by forcing its bones to move however the osteomancer wills. The effect only allows the osteomancer to controle the movement of the creature\'s bone structure, and not its mind. Thus, the osteomancer cannot make the controlled creature speak, but he can cause the creature\'s jaws to clench shut, which would prevent a character from casting a spell with a verbal component or using an item that has a command word. This effect lasts for 1 minute per osteomancer level. Obviously self-destructive commands, such as forcing the creature to walk off a cliff or jump into lava, end the effect. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as long as the osteomancer has line of effect to the subject. Because the osteomancer must remain in line of effect (and therefore potentially keeping himself in harm\'s way), commanding a creature to face an obviously superior foe does not end the effect. As this power targets the bone structure of a being, rather than its mind, corporeal undead are subject to its effect. The osteomancer can use this power three times per day.","osteophage (su)":"This 10th-level ability is the most lethal power at the osteomancer\'s command. Once per day, an osteomancer can cause the skeleton of a target to liquefy in a matter of seconds, causing the target to collapse in on itself This collapse causes instant death on a failed Fortitude save (DC 15 + Charisma modifier); a successful save prevents skeletal collapse but still deals 10d6points of damage."},"class skills":["concentration","craft","disguise","heal","intimidate","knowledge (arcana)","knowledge (architecture and engineering)","knowledge (dungeoneering)","knowledge (geography)","knowledge (history)","knowledge (local)","knowledge (nature)","knowledge (nobility and royalty)","knowledge (psionics)","knowledge (religion)","knowledge (the planes)","spellcraft","use magic device"]},"625":{"name":"Outcast Champion","link":"/classes/races-of-destiny--81/outcast-champion/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"77","requirements":{"race":"Half-elforHalf-OrcorHalf-ogre","skills":["Diplomacy","Intimidate"]},"skill points":{"base":4,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":1,"fort":2,"ref":0,"will":0,"special":["Aura of confidence"]},{"level":2,"bab":2,"fort":3,"ref":0,"will":0,"special":["Avenging strike"]},{"level":3,"bab":3,"fort":3,"ref":1,"will":1,"special":["Desperate fury"]},{"level":4,"bab":4,"fort":4,"ref":1,"will":1,"special":["Teamwork"]},{"level":5,"bab":5,"fort":4,"ref":1,"will":1,"special":["Desperate fury (share with allies)"]}],"hit die":10,"class features":{},"class skills":[]},"626":{"name":"Outlaw of the Crimson Road","link":"/classes/song-and-silence-a-guidebook-to-bards-and-rogues--48/outlaw-of-the-crimson-road/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"94","requirements":{"bab":4,"skills":["Bluff","Disguise","Gather Information","Intimidate","Ride"],"feats":["Expertise","Improved Initiative"],"special":"An appropriate legal authority must pronounce a writ of outlawry upon the character, though he need not actually be guilty of any of the crimes named therein.

fundamental level that most trained soldiers never achieve. At 1st level, an archer gains a +3 bonus on all <a href=\\"/skills/craft/\\">Craft (bowmaking)</a> skill checks.","ranged sneak attack (ex)":"When wearing light armor or no armor, a peerless archer can draw and fire in a split second, catching her targets unawares. She loses this special ability when fighting in medium or heavy armor. At 1st level, a peerless archer gains the ability to execute a ranged sneak attack if she catches an opponent unable to defend himself from attack. Any time the peerless archer\'s opponent would be denied his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (whether he actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), the peerless archer\'s ranged attack deals +1d6 points of extra damage. This extra damage increases to +2d6 at 4th level, +3d6 at 7th level, and +4d6 at 10th level. Should the peerless archer score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied. It takes precision and penetration to hit a vital spot, so her ranged attacks can only count as sneak attacks if the target is no farther than 30 feet away. A peerless archer can only sneak attack living creatures with discernible anatomies&#8212;undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to strike. Additionally, any creature immune to critical hits is similarly immune to sneak attacks. The peerless archer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot. The peerless archer cannot sneak attack while striking at a creature with concealment (unless her sharp shooting ability overcomes the concealment; see below) or by striking at the limbs of a creature whose vitals are not in her line of sight. If the peerless archer gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses to damage stack.","sharp shooting (ex)":"A peerless archer\'s skill with her bow allows her to strike accurately at foes, even when they are attempting to take advantage of cover or concealment. Beginning at 2nd level, a peerless archer\'s targets receive cover or concealment one step worse than they should. For example, a target with three-quarters cover is treated as if he had one-half cover. At 5th level, a peerless archer ignores two steps of cover or concealment, so the same target would be treated as if he had one- quarter cover instead of three quarters cover. At 9th level, a peerless archer ignores three steps of cover or concealment. This ability has no effect against foes with total cover.","fletching (su)":"At 2nd level, a peerless archer gains the ability to create magic arrows (and only arrows) with a +1 enhancement bonus, as if she possessed the <a href=\\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/craft-magic-arms-and-armor--462/\\">Craft Magic Arms and Armor</a> feat and met all other requirements for the arrow she wishes to make.

features":{"weapon and armor proficiency":"Primevals gain no proficiency with weapons, armor, or shields. (They are proficient with their natural weapons while in primeval form, though.)","primeval form (su)":"The primary ability of the primeval is the supernatural ability to assume an alternate form. This functions similarly to the druid\'s wild shape ability, except the alternate form chosen must be selected when the character takes his first level of primeval and cannot be changed after that. Each time the character changes form with this ability, he assumes the same form. At 1st level, he may change shape into his primeval form once per day. He can use this ability one additional time each day at 4th level, 7th level, and again at 10th level. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. It lasts for 1 minute per primeval level, or until he changes back. Changing form (into either form) is a standard action and doesn\'t provoke attacks of opportunity. The primeval does not assume the animal\'s physical ability scores. Instead, he adds the animal\'s ability score &#8212;10 (for even scores) or &#8212;11 (for odd scores) to his own ability scores. For example, a primeval with a Strength score of 16 who assumes the form of a dire lion (Strength 25) adds +14 to his normal Strength of 16 to determine his Strength score in his primeval form. Remember, items that enhance the character\'s ability scores may be rendered inoperative by his change in form. The primeval loses his ability to speak while in primeval form because he is limited to the sounds that the form can make naturally. The primeval form chosen must be a prehistoric animal of some sort (dinosaur, dire animal, or other creature approved by the DM). The primeval form chosen must have no more than 8 HD and cannot be more than one size category larger than the primeval (so a Small character is limited to Medium animals or smaller, and a Medium character is limited to Large or smaller animals). The primeval form can be from any terrain familiar to the character. Appropriate primeval forms for a frostfell environment from the Monster Manual and this book include the dire lion, dire wolf, dire wolverine, and megaloceros. If the primeval has the wild shape ability from other class levels, he may use wild shape to assume his primeval form. He cannot use his primeval form ability to wild shape, however.","animal empathy (ex)":"In any form, the primeval can communicate with animals of his chosen primeval form (or related types). For example, a primeval whose primeval form is a dire wolf may communicate with wolves and dire wolves. He gains a +4 bonus on charisma-based checks against animals of his chosen primeval form and related animals.","regression (su)":"As a primeval gains levels, he begins to physically regress into a more primal, feral version of himself. At 2nd level, the primeval reduces his Intelligence and Charisma scores by 1 point (to a minimum of 3) and gains 1 point of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Wisdom. At 5th level, he repeats his regression, losing an additional point of Intelligence and Charisma, and gaining an additional point to the rest of his ability scores. At 8th level, the primeval regresses again, losing a third point of Intelligence and Charisma but gaining a third point to the rest of his ability scores.","low-light vision (ex)":"In any form, the primeval gains low-light vision at 2nd level. He can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. He retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions. If the primeval already has racial low-light vision, he can instead see four times as far as a human.","feral power (ex)":"As the primeval gains levels, his primeval form grows stronger and tougher, as shown below:","scent (ex)":"At 5th level, the primeval form gains the scent special quality in any form.","fast movement (ex)":"As he grows closer to his animal spirit, the primeval becomes quicker in his humanoid form. At 8th level, his base land speed improves by 10 feet. This benefit does not apply if the primeval is wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.","primeval shapechanger (su)":"The primeval unites with his animal spirit at 10th level. His type changes to magical beast (shapechanger), which means that he is no longer subject to spells that affect humanoids. In addition, he gains damage reduction 10/magic in any form. His natural attacks (but not weapon attacks) overcome damage reduction as if they were magic weapons."},"class skills":["climb","concentration","handle animal","intimidate","jump","knowledge (nature)","listen","spot","survival","swim"]},"658":{"name":"Prophet of Erathaoi","link":"/classes/book-of-exalted-deeds--52/prophet-of-erathaoi/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"3","requirements":{"alignment":["lawful good"],"skills":["Knowledge (arcana)","Spellcraft"],"feats":["Sacred Vow","Servant of the Heavens","Spell Focus","Vow of Chastity"],"spells":"Able to cast 4th-level arcane or divine spells."},"skill points":{"base":2,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":0,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":2,"special":["Ecstasy"],"spells per day":""},{"level":2,"bab":1,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":3,"special":[""],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":3,"bab":1,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":3,"special":[""],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":4,"bab":2,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":4,"special":[""],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":5,"bab":2,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":4,"special":[""],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":6,"bab":3,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":5,"special":[""],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":7,"bab":3,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":5,"special":[""],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":8,"bab":4,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":6,"special":[""],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":9,"bab":4,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":6,"special":[""],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":10,"bab":5,"fort":7,"ref":7,"will":7,"special":[""],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"}],"hit die":6,"class features":{},"class skills":["concentration","craft","heal","intimidate","knowledge (arcana)","knowledge (religion)","knowledge (the planes)","profession","spellcraft"]},"659":{"name":"Psibond Agent","link":"/classes/complete-scoundrel--60/psibond-agent/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"15","requirements":{"skills":["Gather Information","Sense Motive"],"languages":"Any three.","psionics":" Power point reserve of at least 1.","special":" Sneak attack +1d6."},"skill points":{"base":6,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":0,"fort":0,"ref":2,"will":0,"special":["Psibond (forced sense link)"]},{"level":2,"bab":1,"fort":0,"ref":3,"will":0,"special":["Psibond (nudge)"]},{"level":3,"bab":2,"fort":1,"ref":3,"will":1,"special":[6]},{"level":4,"bab":3,"fort":1,"ref":4,"will":1,"special":["Psibond (empathy)"]},{"level":5,"bab":3,"fort":1,"ref":4,"will":1,"special":["Lingering psibond"]},{"level":6,"bab":4,"fort":2,"ref":5,"will":2,"special":["Psibond (suggestion)",6]},{"level":7,"bab":5,"fort":2,"ref":5,"will":2,"special":["Double psibond"]},{"level":8,"bab":6,"fort":2,"ref":6,"will":2,"special":["Psibond (false sensory input)"]},{"level":9,"bab":6,"fort":3,"ref":6,"will":3,"special":[6]},{"level":10,"bab":7,"fort":3,"ref":7,"will":3,"special":["Psibond (dominate)"]}],"hit die":6,"class features":{"psibond (su)":"As a member of this class, you know how to create a mental link between yourself and a subject.

The maximum range at which a psibond can be established is 100 feet, but once in place it persists even if the subject moves out of this range (the psibond is suppressed, but not broken, while the subject is on a different plane).

armor.","infamy":"The ronin\'s reputation for dishonor&#8212;deserved or not&#8212;follows him everywhere. Whenever someone in a position of authority has heard of the ronin\'s past (usually through a DC 10 <a href=\\"/skills/gather-information/\\">Gather Information</a> or <a href=\\"/skills/knowledge-nobility-and-royalty/\\">Knowledge (nobility and royalty)</a> check), that person\'s attitude starts one category worse than usual, and the ronin takes a &#8212;4 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks involving that person. The infamy penalty applies only if the authority figure knows the ronin\'s identity, so some ronin adopt pseudonyms or secret identities.","sneak attack (ex)":"If a ronin can catch an opponent when she is unable to defend herself effectively from his attack, he can strike a vital spot for an extra 1d6 points of damage. This extra damage increases by 1d6 points every third level (+2d6 at 4th level, +3d6 at 7th level, +4d6 at 10th level). For complete details on the sneak attack ability, see the description of the <a href=\\"/classes/dark-hunter/\\">dark hunter</a> earlier in this chapter.","banzai charge (ex)":"The ronin has cast away the code of bushido and at least a measure of his own honor, but his heart still remembers the thrill of bravery. When a ronin of 2nd level or higher charges into battle, he can accept a variable penalty to his Armor Class and take an equivalent bonus on the damage roll. The normal &#8212;2 AC penalty for charging still applies and counts toward the bonus, but the ronin cannot accept a penalty smaller than &#8212;2 or larger than his base attack bonus. For example, a 2nd-level ronin making a banzai charge could take a &#8212;8 penalty to AC in exchange for a +8 bonus on the damage roll.","bonus feat":"The ronin\'s experience in battle has taught him many tricks and techniques.

You do not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained.

When casting arcane spells in any sort of waste terrain, your caster level is considered to be one level higher than your actual caster level. Even in nonwaste environments, as long as you carry 15 or more pounds of sand as part of your equipment, you gain the benefit of this class feature. ","desert insight":"As a member of this class, you gain knowledge of additional spells (see the list below). If you were a caster who previously prepared spells (such as a wizard), you can prepare these spells like any other spell to which you have access. If you are a spontaneous caster (such as a sorcerer), these spells are available to you like any other spell you know. You cannot cast a spell of higher level than the maximum spell level you can cast. These spells become options for you when you gain access to the appropriate spell level.","sand shape (sp)":"All sand shapers know how to magically sculpt the soil of the waste (generally desert sand, dust, or gravel) into mundane objects. You can create any solid object you can imagine, provided you have access to a sufficient quantity of the appropriate soil and you can successfully make a caster level check.

This ability works in all other respects like the spell of the same name (see page 119). ","sand stride (sp)":"At 3rd level and higher, you can fly as by means of the <em>overland flight</em> spell once per day. You must begin and end your flight on a square of waste terrain; if your movement crosses a different type of terrain, your flight ends immediately, dropping you abruptly (albeit safely) to the ground.","improved sand shape (sp)":"At 4th level, you learn to magically sculpt the soil of the waste generally desert sand, dust, or gravel) into animate objects. You can create one of the creatures described below, provided a sufficient quantity of the appropriate soil (3 cubic feet unless otherwise noted) is available and you can successfully make a caster level check; the DC is based on the specific creature. Every creature you create has damage reduction 5&#8212;, but sand shaped creatures reduced to 0 hit points are destroyed. ","improved dust magic (ex)":"At 5th level, your affinity with the waste increases, and your spells grow even more potent. Three times per day, when you cast an arcane spell in any sort of waste terrain, you can empower, enlarge, extend, silence, or still your spell, as the appropriate metamagic feats. These options have the same general effect as the metamagic feats of the same name, except that they do not use up higher-level spell slots, and even if you prepare spells, you can decide to alter them with this ability as you cast a spell. ","desert slumber (ex)":"At 7th level and higher, if you lie in the soil of the waste (generally desert sand, dust, or gravel), you regrow severed body members, mend broken bones, and restore ruined organs as though a regenerate spell had been cast upon you. The soil must be at least deep enough, and occupy a large enough area, to cover all but your face. You can use this ability once per day. ","greater dust magic (ex)":"By 9th level, your affinity with the waste has almost reached its peak. Five times per day, when you cast spells in any sort of waste terrain, you can choose to maximize or widen your spell. Uses of this ability and of improved dust magic (see above) come from the same pool, so you can use both abilities a total of five times per day. For example, you could empower four times per day and maximize once, or widen three times and enlarge two times. These options have the same general effect as the metamagic feats of the same name, except that they do not use up higher-level spell slots, and even if you prepare spells, you can decide to alter them with this ability as you cast a spell. ","desert shroud (ex)":"At 10th level, you gain the ability to come back to life under certain consitions. If the remains of your deceased body lie in the soil of the waste (generally desert sand, dust, or gravel) for 10 minutes, you are restored to life as though a resurrection spell had been cast upon you, provided you have not been dead for more than one hundred years. The soil must be deep enough, and occupy a large enough area, to cover your entire body (based on your size when the effect is complete)."},"class

If you ever lose your armor, or if you want a new suit blessed, a cleric of Tem-Et-Nu can perform the ceremony to bless your armor at any temple devoted to your patron deity. The blessing is free of charge for scions.","river mastery (ex)":"As a member of this class, you gain a +1 insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against river-dwelling aquatic creatures. ","spellcasting":"At each even-numbered level, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level. You do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a scion of Tem-Et-Nu, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known. ","river\'s vigor (su)":"Beginning at 2nd level, you can emulate the vigor and unstoppable power of the river during a spring flood, gaining 5 temporary hit points per scion class level for 1 minute per scion class level once per day. From 6th level on, you can use river\'s vigor two times per day (the temporary hit points gained with each use of this ability do not stack). ","river walk (sp)":"At 3rd level and higher, you can tread on river water as though you were affected by a <em>water walk</em> spell. You can use this ability once per day for every three scion of Tem-Et-Nu levels. Your caster level for this ability is equal to your class level. ","the river\'s life is mine (su)":"At 3rd level and higher, you gain fast healing 5 whenever you begin your turn in or adjacent to a square containing a river. ","smite evil (su)":"Beginning at 4th level, once per day you can attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. You add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your attack roll and deal an extra 1 point of damage per class level. If you accidentally smite a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for the day. You must declare the use of the smite before making the attack roll. Starting at 8th level, you can smite twice per day. If you have levels in a class that grant a smite evil ability (such as paladin), you gain extra uses of that ability, and the levels of that class stack with your scion of Tem-Et-Nu class levels to determine the power of your smite evil ability. ","divine power (sp)":"At 5th level, you gain the benefit of divine power, as the spell, once per day. Your caster level is equal to your class level. If you activate this ability while submerged up to your waist (or deeper) in a river, the amount of time you benefit from the ability does not count toward the duration of the effect until you move out of water of this depth. Once the duration begins to count down, however, it does not stop even if you proceed to immerse yourself in waist-deep water. At 10th level, you can use this ability twice per day. ","control water (sp)":"Beginning at 6th level, you can use control water, as the spell, three times per day. Your caster level is equal to your class level. ","restoring immersion (sp)":"When you attain 7th level, you become able to draw upon the power of Tem-Et-Nu once per day to benefit from a restoration effect if you immerse yourself completely in water for a short time. Restoring negative levels requires that you be immersed for 1 minute per negative level. Curing ability score damage requires 5 rounds per point, and restoring drained ability score points requires 1 minute per point. You can receive more than one benefit during each period of immersion you undergo. For example, you could restore three negative levels and four drained ability points by remaining immersed for 7 consecutive minutes.Your caster level for this ability is equal to your class level. ","divert river (sp)":"At 9th level, you become capable of changing the course of a river for a short time. With slow-moving rivers, this is the equivalent of casting both versions of control water simultaneously: lower water downstream of your location, and raise water aimed at where you divert the river. Water overflows the river\'s bank where you specify, rather than following the natural contours of the river. With fastmoving rivers, the effect is more dramatic: The river downstream is affected as though the lower water version of control water had been cast, and a flashflood effect, as the spell (see page 114), originates at the point on the river that you specify. Regardless of the speed of the river, the effect lasts for 2 hours unless you choose to end it sooner.

Once retrieved, a spell remains set in the sha\'ir\'s memory, like a wizard\'s prepared spell, until cast or until a number of hours pass equal to the sha\'ir\'s class level. A sha\'ir is capable of extraordinarily versatile spellcasting because he can use arcane spells as well as a limited selection of divine spells. A sha\'ir\'s familiar can retrieve any spell on the sorcerer/ wizard spell list, plus any spell from the Air, Chaos, Earth, Fire, Knowledge, Law, Luck, Sun, and Water domain spell lists.

He also gains damage reduction 2/&#8212; against attacks made by any creature with the air, earth, fire, or water subtype. The resistance increases to 4 against the energy type to which his gen is immune (see below), and the damage reduction increases to 4/&#8212; against attacks made by creatures of his gen\'s elemental subtype.

A shadow scout may select another human clan as his favored enemy. Due to his extensive study of his foes and training in the proper techniques for combating them, the scout gains a +1 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Wilderness Lore checks when using these skills against this type of creature. Likewise, he gets the same bonus on weapon damage rolls against creatures of this type. The shadow scout also gets the damage bonus with ranged weapons, but only against targets within 30 feet. The bonus doesn\'t apply to damage against creatures that are immune to critical hits. At 4th level and at every three levels thereafter (4th, 7th, and 10th level), the bonus goes up by +1.

If the scout makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. The shadow scout can only use evasion if he is wearing light armor or no armor.","<em>detect</em> enemy (sp)":"At 3rd level, a shadow scout gains the ability to detect the presence of his favored enemy. The ability is similar to the <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/detect-evil--2486/\\"><em>detect evil</em></a> spell in range, area, and duration. In the first round of concentration, the shadow scout can ascertain the presence or absence of his favored enemy within the area. In the second round, the shadow scout can determine the number of creatures in the area and the power of the strongest one (as per the <em>detect evil</em> spell). In the third round, the shadow scout can determine the strength and location of each creature. If the shadow scout has more than one favored enemy, he can detect any of them, and on the second round he can determine what kind of creature is in the area.","memory":"At 6th level, a shadow scout\'s memory is greatly enhanced. He can hold in his mind an image he has seen or up to 1 minute of speech, and can describe the details or repeat the words (even if he does not speak the language) as if he were still present. The shadow scout can only hold one image or sound in his mind at a time.","freeze (su)":"By keeping completely still while using the Hide skill, a shadow scout of 8th level or higher can vanish into his surroundings. He gains a +15 bonus on his Hide check. The shadow scout can use this ability three times per day.","smite enemy (su)":"A 9th-level shadow scout gains the ability to smite his favored enemy once per day. He adds his Intelligence modifier (if positive) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per level. This damage bonus stacks with his favored enemy bonus. If the shadow scout has more than one favored enemy, he can smite any of them, but can still use the ability only once per day."},"class skills":["climb","craft","hide","intuit

any reason, he may not take additional levels in this prestige class, but he does not lose any class abilities from levels already attained.","pierce shadows (su)":"A shadowbane inquisitor can spend one of his daily uses of his turn undead ability to shed a holy radiance. This light brightly illuminates an area in a radius of 20 feet plus 5 feet per class level of the inquisitor. The light is centered on the inquisitor and sheds no shadowy illumination beyond its border. This radiance lasts for 10 minutes per inquisitor class level.","sacred stealth (su)":"Starting at 2nd level, a shadowbane inquisitor can channel some of his divine spell power to become stealthier. To do this, he must lose a prepared divine spell from memory (or give up a potential spell slot for the day if he casts spells as a sorcerer). He gains a +4 sacred bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks for a number of minutes equal to his Charisma bonus (if any) plus the level of spell given up in this manner.","smite (su)":"Once per day, a shadowbane inquisitor of 2nd level or higher can attempt to smite a creature that he judges to be corrupt with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per inquisitor class level. Unlike with a paladin\'s smite evil ability, an inquisitor relies only on his own judgment when determining what creatures to use this ability against. How an inquisitor uses this ability exemplifies his outlook on the world. The more suspicious and uncompromising an inquisitor is, the more likely he is to feel that a creature should be struck down.","improved sunder":"At 3rd level, a shadowbane becomes accomplished at shattering the weapons of his foes and tainted magic items. He gains the Improved Sunder feat as a bonus feat.","sneak attack (ex)":"Beginning at 4th level, a shadowbane inquisitor deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or any time the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 7th level and 3d6 points at 10th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the Player\'s Handbook. If a shadowbane inquisitor gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as levels of rogue), the bonuses on damage stack.","merciless purity (su)":"Beginning at 5th level, a shadowbane inquisitor benefits when his enemies perish. Upon the death of a creature that the inquisitor has designated as corrupt, he gains a +1 sacred bonus on his Fortitude and Reflex saves for the next 24 hours. An inquisitor designates a creature as corrupt in his eyes by using his smite ability (see above) as part of a melee attack against the creature. The inquisitor need not kill the creature himself. An inquisitor can benefit from this ability only once per day; subsequent deaths of creatures that he has designated as corrupt grant no special benefit.","righteous fervor (su)":"When an inquisitor of 8th level or higher designates a creature as corrupt, he gains a +1 sacred bonus on attack and damage rolls against that creature for the rest of the encounter. The inquisitor designates a creature as corrupt by using his smite ability (see above) as part of a melee attack against the creature. This bonus does not apply to the smite attempt itself, only to subsequent attacks against the same creature made in that encounter.","burning light (su)":"At 9th level and higher, an inquisitor can spend one of his daily uses of his turn undead ability to deal damage to creatures around him.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the new level of shaper of form to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly. For example, if an 8th-level cleric gains a level in shaper of form, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 9th level in cleric but uses the other shaper of form aspects of level progression such as attack bonus and save bonus. If she next gains a level of cleric, making her a 9th-level cleric/1st-level shaper of form, she gains spells as if she had risen to become a loth-level cleric.","like begets like (su)":"Once per day per three class levels, the shaper of form can change one nonmagic object of her size or smaller into a similar object of the same size. Similar items have the same or nearly the same shape and weight within 50% of each other. Similar items must also share a material in their construction that constitutes at least half of their form. For example, the shaper of form can transform a scimitar into a longsword, since both are swords that weight the same. She cannot change a dagger into a short sword, for example, because a short sword weighs twice as much as a dagger. The shaper of form could also change a set of leather armor into a set of studded leather but not a chain shirt (because the chain shirt is made of steel and not leather). Sometimes, overall improvements can be made, but the value of the item cannot increase by more than double its original worth. This change is permanent and cannot be dispelled or otherwise removed by any means short of a wish or miracle.","modify self (ex)":"At 1st level and every three levels thereafter (at 4th, 7th, and 10th level), the shaper of form can gain one effect from the following list, achieved through applying shaping magic to her own body. The effect is permanent. The shaper of form can choose the same ability more than once&#8212;the effects of each ability stack with themselves. For example, a shaper of form who takes the resilience ability three times has a permanent +3 natural armor bonus to her Armor Class.

They are not proficient with any type of armor, nor with shields. In their home culture, it is considered inappropriate for a shugenja to wear armor, although shugenjas serving with the military or traveling in foreign lands sometimes take the time to learn how to wear armor properly. Armor check penalties for armor heavier than leather apply to the skills Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, Swim, and Tumble. Armor does not interfere with his spellcasting.","spells":"A shugenja casts divine spells (the same type of spells available to clerics and druids), which are drawn from the shugenja spell list (page 144). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below).","element focus":"All shugenjas have a favored element: air, earth, fire, or water. A shugenja\'s choice of specialized element is sometimes determined by the shugenja order in which he studies. At least half the spells a shugenja knows at each spell level must belong to his favored element, and the spell dictated by his order often belongs to that element as well. This is reflected on Table 1&#8212;4, which indicates how many spells of each level must be spells of the shugenja\'s favored element. At 1st level, for example, the shugenja Kitsu Mari must know at least three 0-level water spells&#8212;one water spell determined by his order and two additional water spells, plus two other 0-level spells of any element. He also knows one 1st-level water spell from his order, one additional 1st-level water spell, and one 1st-level spell of any element. Shugenjas automatically gain the benefits of the Spell Focus feat (+1 to spell DCs) for spells from their favored element, regardless of its school.

In addition, repeated Heal checks after the first to remove the pellet deal 1d6 points of damage to the patient instead of the usual 1d4 points, as the healer must cut more deeply into the host\'s body.","rapid hatching (ex)":"On reaching 4th level, a slaad brooder gains the ability to transfer some of his own vitality into the egg pellet, allowing it to mature more quickly. The egg hatches in 24 hours instead of 1 week. Six hours before it hatches, the host comes down with the severe illness, losing 10 points from each ability score.","chaos focus (su)":"At 5th level, a slaad brooder\'s imbue pellet ability becomes more potent: The DC to halve or negate the damage from the additional feature of the pellet (burn, caustic, chill, or shock) increases by +2.","multiple implant (ex)":"At 6th level, a slaad brooder can implant more than one pellet within the host\'s body. Each of his natural attacks that hits can implant an egg pellet.","color choice (ex)":"At 7th level, a slaad brooder can choose the color of his spawn. He can produce a green slaad even if the host creature is not an arcane spellcaster. He can determine the color of each pellet\'s spawn if he has implanted more than one in the same host.","heighten chaos (su)":"At 8th level, the DC to halve or negate the damage from the additional feature of an egg pellet increases by +2. This bonus stacks with the bonus provided by the chaos focus ability.","corporeal instability (su)":"On reaching 9th level, a slaad brooder can effect a terrible transformation on the host creature. Unless she makes a successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + slaad brooder\'s level + Slaad brooder\'s Con modifier), the host\'s shape melts into a formless mass. She cannot hold or use any item, nor can she wear clothing or armor. Her speed drops to 10 feet or one-quarter normal, whichever is lower. She can no longer cast spells or use magic items, and she cannot distinguish between friend and foe, attacking blindly (&#8212;4 penalty on attack rolls, 50% miss chance).","death spawn (ex)":"At 9th level, a slaad brooder\'s extraordinary vitality gives his egg pellets the ability to hatch even from a host that has died (the death of a host becomes an increasingly likely event as a brooder<br />becomes more powerful). Neither <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/remove-disease--2428/\\"><em>remove disease</em></a> spells nor Heal checks can destroy the pellets growing in a dead host, but destruction of the body by fire, acid, <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/disintegrate--2801/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/disintegrate--2801/\\"><em>disintegrate</em></a> spells, and the like will do so.","<em>dominate spawn</em> (sp)":"On reaching 10th level, the slaad brooder becomes the undisputed master of spawn. If he is present at the hatching of a red, blue, or green slaad, he can take control of the newborn<br />as with a <a href=\\"/spells/players-handbook-v35--6/dominate-monster--2546/\\"><em>dominate monster</em></a> spell. The effect lasts one day per slaad brooder\'s character level. The hatchling can resist the effect with a successful Will save (DC 10 + slaad brooder\'s level + slaad brooder\'s Con modifier).

features":{"spells per day":"At every odd-numbered level, a spell sword gains new spells per day as if he had also gained a level in an arcane spellcasting class he belonged to before adding the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, and so on), save for an increased effective level of spellcasting. If a character had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a spellsword, he must decide to which class he adds the new level for purposes of determining spells per day.","ignore spell failure (ex)":"Beginning at 1st level, a spell sword\'s hard work and practice at merging spellcraft with weaponplay starts to pay off. As an extraordinary ability, he ignores a portion of the arcane spell failure chance associated with using armor. This reduction starts at 10%and gradually increases to 30%, as shown on the class table. A spellsword subtracts the given percentage value from his total spell failure chance, if any. For instance, a character wearing scale mail and carrying a small shield normally has a spell failure chance of 30%, but this drops to only 20% for a 1st-level spellsword.","bonus feat":"At 2nd level, a spellsword advances his art, gaining a bonus feat. This bonus feat must be either a metamagic feat or one drawn from the list of bonus feats allowed to a fighter (see Table 5&#8212;1 on page 90 of the Player\'s Handbook).","channel spell (sp)":"At 4th level, a spellsword can channel any spell he can cast into his melee weapon. Using this ability requires a move action, and the spellsword uses up the prepared spell or spell slot just as if he had cast the spell. The channeled spell affects the next target that the spell sword successfully attacks with his weapon (saving throws and spell resistance still apply). Even if the spell normally affects an area or is a ray, it affects only the target. The spell is discharged from the weapon, which can then hold an other spell. A spellsword can channel his spells into only one weapon at a time. Spells channeled into a weapon are lost if not used in 8 hours.","multiple channel spell (sp)":"A 10th-level spellsword can channel two spells into his melee weapon, using a move action to channel each one. Both channeled spells affect the next target the spellsword successfully attacks with his weapon, in the order the spells were placed into the weapon. As with the channel spell class feature, saving throws and spell resistance apply normally. Each time a spellsword uses multiple channel spell, two of his five channel spell uses per day are expended."},"class skills":["climb","concentration","jump","knowledge","profession","spellcraft"]},"812":{"name":"Spellsword","link":"/classes/tome-and-blood-a-guidebook-to-wizards-and-sorcerers--51/spellsword/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"101","requirements":{}},"813":{"name":"Spellthief","link":"/classes/complete-adventurer--54/spellthief/","isPrestige":false,"bookId":"9","skill points":{"base":6,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":0,"fort":0,"ref":0,"will":2,"special":[6,"steal spell (0 or 1st)","trapfinding"],"1st":"","2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":2,"bab":1,"fort":0,"ref":0,"will":3,"special":["Detect magic",1,"steal spell effect"],"1st":"","2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":3,"bab":2,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":3,"special":[10],"1st":"","2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":4,"bab":3,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":["Steal spell (2nd)"],"1st":0,"2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":5,"bab":3,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":[6,"steal spell-like ability"],"1st":0,"2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":6,"bab":4,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":5,"special":["Steal spell (3rd)"],"1st":1,"2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":7,"bab":5,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":5,"special":["Absorb spell"],"1st":1,"2nd":"","3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":8,"bab":6,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":6,"special":["Steal spell (4th)"],"1st":1,"2nd":0,"3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":9,"bab":6,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":6,"special":["Arcane sight",6],"1st":1,"2nd":0,"3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":10,"bab":7,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":7,"special":["Steal spell (5th)"],"1st":1,"2nd":1,"3rd":"","4th":""},{"level":11,"bab":8,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":7,"special":[2,20],"1st":1,"2nd":1,"3rd":0,"4th":""},{"level":12,"bab":9,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":8,"special":["Steal spell (6th)"],"1st":1,"2nd":1,"3rd":1,"4th":""},{"level":13,"bab":9,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":8,"special":["Discover spells",6],"1st":1,"2nd":1,"3rd":1,"4th":""},{"level":14,"bab":10,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":9,"special":["Steal spell (7th)"],"1st":2,"2nd":1,"3rd":1,"4th":0},{"level":15,"bab":11,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":9,"special":["Steal spell resistance"],"1st":2,"2nd":1,"3rd":1,"4th":1},{"level":16,"bab":12,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":10,"special":["Steal spell (8th)"],"1st":2,"2nd":2,"3rd":1,"4th":1},{"level":17,"bab":12,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":10,"special":[6],"1st":2,"2nd":2,"3rd":2,"4th":1},{"level":18,"bab":13,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":11,"special":["Steal spell (9th)"],"1st":3,"2nd":2,"3rd":2,"4th":1},{"level":19,"bab":14,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":11,"special":[30],"1st":3,"2nd":3,"3rd":3,"4th":2},{"level":20,"bab":15,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":12,"special":["Absorb spell (immediate casting)",3],"1st":3,"2nd":3,"3rd":3,"4th":3}],"hit die":6,"starting gold":10,"class features":{"weapon and armor proficiency":"Spellthieves are proficient with all simple weapons and with light armor but not with shields. Because the somatic components required for spellthief spells are simple, a spellthief can cast spellthief spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, a spellthief wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure (see page 123 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>) if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass spellthief still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes, including those stolen from arcane casters (see the steal spell ability, below).","sneak attack (ex)":"A spellthief deals an extra 1d6 points of damage when flanking an opponent or at any time when the target would be denied its Dexterity bonus. This extra damage applies to ranged attacks only if the target is within 30 feet. It increases to 2d6 points at 5th level, 3d6 points at 9th level, 4d6 points at 13th level, and 5d6 points at 17th level. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>. If a spellthief gets a sneak attack bonus from another source (such as rogue levels), the bonuses on damage stack.","steal spell (su)":"A spellthief can siphon spell energy away from his target and use it himself. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead steal a spell, or the potential to cast a specific known spell, from his target. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell with a touch as a standard action.","trapfinding (ex)":"A spellthief can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and he can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps. See the rogue class feature, page 50 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>.","detect magic (sp)":"A spellthief of 2nd level or higher can use <em>detect magic</em> a number of times per day equal to his Charisma bonus, if any (minimum 1). His caster level is equal to his spellthief class level.","spellgrace (su)":"A spellthief of 2nd level or higher gains a +1 competence bonus on his saves against spells. This bonus improves to +2 at 11th level and to +3 at 20th level.","steal spell effect (su)":"Beginning at 2nd level, a spellthief can siphon an active spell effect from another creature. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead gain the effect of a single spell affecting the target. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell effect with a touch as a standard action.","steal energy resistance (su)":"Beginning at 3rd level, a spellthief can siphon off some or all of a target\'s resistance to an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). A spellthief who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead temporarily gain resistance 10 to an energy type to which his target is resistant or immune). If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal energy resistance with a touch as a standard action.","spells":"Beginning at 4th level, a spellthief gains the ability to cast a small number of arcane spells, which are drawn from a subset of the sorcerer/wizard spell list (see below). He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, just as a sorcerer can (see page 54 of the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>).","steal spell-like ability (su)":"At 5th level and higher, a spellthief can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal a creature\'s spell-like ability. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead gain one use of one of the target\'s spell-like abilities. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell-like ability with a touch as a standard action.","absorb spell (su)":"Beginning at 7th level, if a spellthief makes a successful save against a spell that targets him, he can attempt to absorb the spell energy for later use. This ability affects only spells that have the spellthief asa target, not effect or area spells. A spellthief can\'t absorb a spell of a higher spell level than he could steal with his steal spell ability (see above).","arcane sight (sp)":"Beginning at 9th level, a spellthief can use <em>arcane sight</em> as a swift action (see page 137) a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier (minimum 1). His caster level is equal to his spellthief class level.","discover spells (ex)":"A spellthief of 13th level or higher who steals a spell from a spellcaster with his steal spell ability automatically learns the names of all other spells prepared or known by the spellcaster that are of the same spell level as the stolen spell. This knowledge allows the spellthief to better choose which spells to steal on subsequent attacks.","steal spell resistance (su)":"Beginning at 15th level, a spellthief can use a sneak attack to temporarily steal some or all of a creature\'s spell resistance. A spellthief who hits an opponent with a sneak attack can choose to forgo 3d6 points of sneak attack damage and instead reduce the target\'s spell resistance by 5.

If you had more than one spellcasting class before becoming a spellwarp sniper, you must decide to which class to add each level for the purpose of determining spells per day, caster level, and spells known.","spellwarp (ex)":"You can alter the form of certain area spells into rays as you cast them. As a free action, you can warp a 1st-level area spell with instantaneous duration and a range greater than touch. The spell\'s level, components, range, and damage (if any) remain unchanged. However, the spell\'s area entry is replaced by an effect entry of &quot;ray.&quot; The spell acts in all ways as a ray, and is considered a ray for the purpose of effects that modify or depend on rays (such as the other abilities of this prestige class). You must succeed on a ranged touch attack to affect an opponent with the spell. Even if the original spell allowed a Reflex save to reduce or negate its effect, the ray does not. However, if the original spell allowed a Fortitude or Will save to reduce or negate the spell\'s effect, the save still applies.","sudden raystrike (ex)":"If you can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from your ray attack, you can strike a vital spot for extra damage. Whenever the target of one of your ray spells is denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus of not), you deal an extra 1d6 points of damage with your ray spell. (If your ray spell doesn\'t deal hit point damage, this extra damage doesn\'t apply.) At 4th level, the extra damage increases to 2d6. If you get a sneak attack or sudden strike bonus from another source (such as rogue or ninja levels), the bonuses on damage stack whenever both abilities would apply to the same target. This damage applies only to targets within 30 feet.

dagger, dart, hand axe, javelin, longspear, quarterstaff, shortspear, spear, sling, shortbow, throwing axe, and with light armor and shields. These are the weapons commonly used by the tribal societies in which spirit shamans are found.","spells":"A spirit shaman casts divine spells from the druid spell list. She can cast any spell she has retrieved, much like a bard or sorcerer can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time.","spirit guide":"All spirit shamans have a spirit guide, a personification of the spirit world. In some sense a spirit shaman and her guide are one being, both knowing and seeing and experiencing the same things. Unlike a familiar, a spirit guide is not a separate entity from a spirit shaman. She is the only one who can perceive or interact with her guide. It exists only inside her own mind and soul.","wild empathy (ex)":"Guided by her insight into animal spirits, a spirit shaman can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (a monster of the animal type). This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person (see Chapter 4: Skills in the <em>Player\'s Handbook</em>). The spirit shaman rolls 1d20 and adds her spirit shaman level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.","chastise spirits (su)":"Beginning at 2nd level, a spirit shaman can use divine energy granted by her patrons in the spirit world to damage hostile spirits (see the What is a Spirit? sidebar). ","detect spirits (sp)":"The spirit shaman\'s spirit guide perceives nearby spirits. At will, the spirit shaman can use detect spirits as a spell-like ability. It functions just like detect undead, except it detects creatures that are considered spirits.","blessing of the spirits (sp)":"Starting at 4th level, a spirit shaman can perform a special rite to gain a special blessing. The shaman goes into a meditative state in which she travels to the spirit world. Performing the rite requires 10 minutes; the spirit shaman can only ward herself with this ability and cannot perform the rite for anyone else. The blessing functions just like <em>protection from evil</em>, except it protects against spirits and lasts until it is dismissed or dispelled. If this ability is dispelled, the spirit shaman can recreate it simply by taking 10 minutes to do so.","follow the guide (su)":"At 5th level and higher, a spirit shaman\'s spirit guide helps her maintain control of her mind. If a spirit shaman is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw. ","ghost warrior (su)":"Beginning at 6th level, a spirit shaman confers the ghost touch special ability (see Magic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions, page 223 of the <em>Dungeon Master\'s Guide</em>) to any weapon she holds for as long as she holds it. She also becomes resistant to the touch attacks of incorporeal creatures, and may use her normal Armor Class (not her touch AC) against any touch attack delivered by an incorporeal creature.","warding of the spirits (sp)":"Starting at 7th level, a spirit shaman can perform a special rite once per day to ward herself and her companions against hostile spirits. Performing the rite requires 1 minute. The warding lasts for 10 minutes per level and otherwise functions like <em>magic circle against evil</em>, except it protects against spirits.","spirit form (su)":"At 9th level and higher, a spirit shaman learns how to temporarily transform herself into a spirit. Once per day, as a standard action, she can make herself incorporeal for up to 1 minute.","guide magic (su)":"Starting at 10th level, as a free action, a spirit shaman can assign her spirit guide the task of concentrating on a spell or spell-like ability that is maintained through concentration. The spirit shaman can act normally while her spirit guide concentrates on the spell. A spirit guide can concentrate on only one spell at a time. If necessary to maintain the spell, the spirit guide makes Concentration checks for the spirit shaman, using the spirit shaman\'s normal Concentration modifier. A spirit guide does not have to make Concentration checks for circumstances such as the spirit shaman taking damage. The spirit itself is not present for anyone to interrupt or otherwise interact with.","recall spirit (sp)":"At 11th level, a spirit shaman gains the ability to call back the spirit of a dead creature before the spirit of the deceased has completely left the body. Once per week, she can reconnect a spirit to its body, restoring life to a recently deceased creature. The ability must be used within 1 round of the victim\'s death. This ability functions like raise dead, except that the raised creature receives no level loss, no thus may survive a blow that otherwise would have killed her. The rite\'s protection is discharged once it is triggered,","exorcism (su)":"Starting at 13th level, as a full-round action, a spirit shaman can force a possessing creature or spirit out of the body it inhabits (for example, a ghost with the malevolence ability). To exorcise a possessing creature, she makes a class level check (also adding her Charisma modifier, if any), against a DC of 10 + the possessing creature\'s HD + its Charisma modifier (if any). If her result equals or exceeds the DC, she succeeds in forcing the possessor from the body, with the normal results based on its method of possession. A spirit so exorcised cannot attempt to possess the same victim for 24 hours.","weaken spirits (su)":"At 16th level and higher, a spirit shaman can choose to strip spirits of their defenses instead of damaging them with her chastise spirits ability. When a spirit is weakened, it loses its spell resistance and any damage reduction overcome by magic weapons, silver or cold iron weapons, and aligned weapons (but not damage reduction overcome by adamantine weapons or not overcome by anything). In addition, an incorporeal spirit loses its immunity to nonmagical attack, its 50% chance to ignore damage from corporeal sources, and its ability to move into or through objects.","spirit journey (sp)":"A spirit shaman knows how to vanish bodily into the spirit world beginning at 17th level. This ability functions like the spell shadow walk, except that a spirit shaman can only transport herself. She need not use the ability in a shadowy area, and she travels through the Plane of Spirits, not the Plane of Shadows. A spirit shaman can use this ability once per day.","favored of the spirits (sp)":"At 19th level, a spirit shaman learns how to perform a special rite that guards her from death. Performing the rite requires 8 hours, and the spirit shaman must bargain away part of her life force, expending 1,000 experience points. The rite\'s effect lasts until it is dismissed or discharged.","spirit who walks (ex)":"At 20th level, a spirit shaman becomes one with the spirit world. She is forevermore treated as a fey instead of a humanoid for purposes of spells and magical effects. Additionally, she gains damage reduction 5/cold iron."},"class skills":["concentration","craft","diplomacy","handle animal","heal","knowledge (geography)","knowledge (history)","knowledge

A swashbuckler loses this bonus when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load. ","acrobatic charge (ex)":"A swashbuckler of 7th level or higher can charge in situations where others cannot. She may charge over difficult terrain that normally slows movement or allies blocking her path. This ability enables her to run down steep stairs, leap down from a balcony, or to tumble over tables to get to her target. Depending on the circumstance, she may still need to make appropriate checks (Jump or Tumble checks, in particular) to successfully move over the terrain.","improved flanking (ex)":"A swashbuckler of 8th level or higher who is flanking an opponent gains a +4 bonus on attacks instead of a +2 bonus on attacks. (Other characters flanking with the swashbuckler don\'t gain this increased bonus.)","lucky (ex)":"Many swashbucklers live by the credo &quot;Better lucky than good.&quot; Once per day, a swashbuckler of 11th level or higher may re-roll any failed attack roll, skill check, ability check, or saving throw. The character must take the result of the re-roll, even if it\'s worse than the original roll.","acrobatic skill mastery (ex)":"At 13th level, a swashbuckler becomes so certain in the use of her acrobatic skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions.

You ready your maneuvers by meditating and exercising for 5 minutes. The maneuvers you choose remain readied until you decide to meditate again and change them. You need not sleep or rest for any long period of time to ready your maneuvers; any time you spend 5 minutes in meditation, you can change your readied maneuvers.","stances known":"You begin play with knowledge of one 1st-level stance from any discipline open to you. At 2nd, 5th, 9th, 14th, and 20th level, you can choose additional stances. Unlike maneuvers, stances are not expended, and you do not have to ready them. All the stances you know are available to you at all times, and you can change the stance you currently use as a swift action. A stance is an extraordinary ability unless otherwise stated in the stance description. ","ac bonus":"Starting at 2nd level, you can add your Wisdom modifier as a bonus to Armor Class, so long as you wear light armor, are unencumbered, and do not use a shield. This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks or when you are flat-footed. However, you lose this bonus when you are immobilized or helpless.","discipline focus (ex)":"As a swordsage, you can focus your training to take advantage of each discipline\'s fighting style. Each time you gain the discipline focus ability, select one of the six swordsage disciplines to which that focus applies. You can select a different discipline each time you gain discipline focus, but you must know at least one martial maneuver from the selected discipline. Even if you select a different discipline at higher levels, your discipline choice for earlier abilities does not change.","quick to act (ex)":"You gain a +1 bonus on initiative checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level.","sense magic (su)":"Beginning at 7th level, you can spend 10 minutes focusing upon a weapon or suit of armor. If you succeed on a level check (DC 10 + the caster level of the weapon or armor), you can identify the properties of that item, including its enhancement bonus and special abilities. This ability does not reveal the properties of artifacts or legacy weapons, though it does indicate that such items are significantly powerful.","evasion (ex)":"At 9th level, you can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If you make a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals damage on a successful save, you instead take no damage. Evasion can be used only if you are wearing light armor or no armor. If you are helpless, you do not gain the benefit of evasion.","improved evasion (ex)":"From 17th level on, you gain the benefit of improved evasion.

When making an offensive strike, the tactical soldier gains a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls and damage rolls for 1 round.

All normal restrictions on cleave attempts and attacks of opportunity apply.","unbalancing blow (ex)":"Starting at 8th level, a tactical soldier can use a full-round action to make a strategic melee attack against an enemy. If the attack succeeds, in addition to dealing regular damage, the blow unbalances the target so much that it provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures threatening its square. This ability works only on creatures up to one size category larger than the tactical soldier.","reciprocal strike (ex)":"A 10th-level tactical soldier can make an attack of opportunity (subject to normal restrictions) against a foe that successfully attacks an ally of the soldier and deals damage.

They find armor to be distasteful and rude, and although they are proficient with padded, leather, and studded leather armor, they prefer to wear armor only when adventuring. The DM may allow urban druids to wear other forms of light armor that provide less than a +4 armor bonus as well.

At 3rd-level, an urban druid\'s ability to fight in these conditions improves greatly. As long as she is fighting in an area no wider than her space (5 feet for a Small or Medium humanoid), she gains a +1 competence bonus on all attack rolls. Additionally, if she makes a melee attack against a target around a<br />corner, the target does not gain the benefit of cover (unless the foe has total cover). The urban druid retains the benefits of cover against her enemy, unless she is fighting another urban druid or other creature with a similar power.","disease immunity (ex)":"At 4th level, an urban druid becomes immune to all forms of disease, including supernatural diseases like mummy rot.","urban shape (su)":"At 5th-level, an urban druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium urban creature.

While in any of these cities, the urban druid only takes half an hour to make a Gather Information check (rather than a full evening or day). In addition, if any event occurs in a city that would interest the urban druid, she may make a Gather Information check to learn of the event as a free action.

She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, metamagic or item creation feats, hit points, beyond those received from the prestige class, and so on), except for an increased effective level of spellcasting. This essentially means that she adds the new level of vermin lord to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells knowns, and caster level accordingly. For example, if Silican, an 8th-level wizard, gains a level in vermin lord, he gains new spells as if she had risen to 9th level in wizard, bus he uses the other vermin lord aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonus. If he next gains a level of wizard, making him a 9th-level wizard/ 1st-level vermin lord, he gains spells as if she had risen to 10-th level wizard.

Thus, a 7th-level vermin lord\'s swarm armor can absorb up to 35 points of damage, although no more that 10 points from any one attack.<br />If a vermin lord is already wearing armor, the swarm armor has no effect. ","wings of the vermin (su)":"A vermin lord of 5th level or higher can sprout massive, buzzing insectoid wings from his back once per day. With these wings, he can fly at his normal land speed with average maneuverability for 1 hour. The vermin lord can carry his normal carrying capacity, and greater burdens affect his speed as they would affect his land speed.

proficiency":"Void disciples gain no weapon or armor proficiencies.","spells per day":"A Void disciple continues her magical training while mastering the powers of Void. At 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 11th, and 12th level, the character gains new spells per day and spells known as if she had also gained one level in a previous spellcasting class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit of the other spellcasting class. For example, if Isawa Todari, a 7th-level shugenja/1st-level Void disciple, gains a level in Void disciple, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 8th level in shugenja, but uses the other Void disciple aspects of level progression such as attack bonus and save bonus. If she next gains a level of shugenja, making her an 8th-level shugenja/ 2nd-level Void disciple, she gains spells as if she had risen to 9th level in shugenja.","sense void (su)":"The first technique taught to the Void disciple is the ability to reach out with the mind and sense the world around, exploring the unseen layer of reality most people rarely experience. The Void disciple\'s consciousness actually departs her body and extends into the world, allowing her to use her normal senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell) to perceive whatever area, person, or thing she directs her attention to. The Void disciple must make a &quot;Scry&quot;skills/scry/ check, with the DC determined by distance, not familiarity.","moment of clarity (su)":"At 4th level, a Void disciple can grant an ally the temporary ability to perform any skill or feat (with the exception of ancestor feats). The Void disciple must use a standard action to touch the target. The target gains either one feat or a number of ranks in one skill equal to his relevant ability modifier for that skill. For example, a character with a 14 Dexterity could gain 2 ranks in Ride, for a total skill modifier of +4. The effect lasts for 1 round per level of the Void disciple. The Void disciple can use this supernatural ability twice per day at 4th level, plus an additional use for every four additional levels she attains.","altering the course (su)":"Once per day, a Void disciple of 7th level or higher can add a +20 bonus to any single attack roll, skill check, or ability check she makes. She cannot transfer this bonus to another character by any means. This supernatural ability requires no action, and lasts only the duration of the single check.","void release (su)":"Three times per day, a Void disciple of 10th level or higher can touch an ally, allowing that character to use her highest ability score modifier in place of any one lower modifier (target\'s choice) for a number of rounds equal to half the Void disciple\'s level. For example, a severely wounded samurai could use his high Strength modifier in place of his low Dexterity modifier for a few rounds, increasing his Armor Class, Reflex save bonus, and ranged attack bonus (as well as Dexterity-based skills).","void suppression (su)":"Once per day, a 12th-level Void disciple can make a melee touch attack to force the target to use his lowest ability score modifier in place of any one higher modifier (Void disciple\'s choice) for 5 rounds. For example, a Void disciple could force an ogre to use his low Intelligence modifier in place of his high Strength modifier, severely weakening the brute\'s physical blows.","void strike (su)":"Once per day, a 13th-level Void disciple can make a melee touch attack to bestow 1d4 negative levels on the target. The Void disciple gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level she bestows. If the target has at least as many negative levels as HD, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature a -1 competence penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks, and effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). Additionally, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from his highest available level. Negative levels stack. Assuming the target survives, he regains lost levels after 13 hours pass. This ability relies on the Void disciple\'s mastery of Void, not negative energy, so it cannot be used to benefit undead."},"class skills":["alchemy","concentration","craft","diplomacy","heal","knowledge (arcana)","knowledge (architecture and engineering)","knowledge (barbarian lore)","knowledge (geography)","knowledge (history)","knowledge (local)","knowledge (nature)","knowledge (nobility and royalty)","knowledge (religion)","knowledge (shadowlands)","knowledge (spirits)","knowledge (war)","profession","scry","spellcraft"]},"925":{"name":"Walker In the Waste","link":"/classes/sandstorm--85/walker-in-the-waste/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"85","requirements":{"feats":["Heat Endurance"],"alignment":["any nongood."],"spells":" Ability to cast at least three spells of the Sand or Thirst domain as divine spells."},"skill points":{"base":2,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":0,"fort":0,"ref":0,"will":2,"special":[6,"Improved Heat Endurance"],"spellcasting":"&#8211;"},{"level":2,"bab":1,"fort":0,"ref":0,"will":3,"special":["The wasting"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":3,"bab":1,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":3,"special":[6,"local drought"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":4,"bab":2,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":["Withered toughness"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":5,"bab":2,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":[6,"pillar of salt"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":6,"bab":3,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":5,"special":["Create sand golem"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":7,"bab":3,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":5,"special":[6],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":8,"bab":4,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":6,"special":["Create salt mummy"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":9,"bab":4,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":6,"special":[6,"greater drought"],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing spellcasting class"},{"level":10,"bab":5,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":7,"special":["Dry lich"],"spellcasting":"&#8211;"}],"hit die":6,"class features":{"spellcasting":"At each level except 1st and 10th, you gain new spells per day and an increase in caster level (and spells known, if applicable) as if you had also gained a level in a spellcasting class to which you belonged before adding the prestige class level.

At every odd-numbered level thereafter, the dessication damage increases by 1d6 (or 1d8), to a maximum of 5d6 (or 5d8) at 9th level.

Using this ability is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. You can pick up dust from the ground as a move action or take it from a pouch as a free action. The opponent is entitled to a Reflex save (DC 10 + walker in the waste level + your Wis modifier) to avoid inhaling the dust. On a success, the dust has no effect and drifts harmlessly to the ground. An opponent who fails this save contracts the wasting, a supernatural affliction that gradually mummifies its victims (see Disease, page 21).","local drought (su)":"Beginning at 3rd level, you can produce desert conditions in a 20-foot-radius emanation with you at the center. The temperature band in that area rises by one step or to hot, whichever produces the hotter result. (See Heat Dangers and the effects of natural dehydration in Chapter 1.) You can suppress this effect for 1 round as a free action, but it renews automatically on your next turn unless you consciously suppress it again.","withered toughness (ex)":"When you attain 4th level, your body becomes inured to the arid conditions in which you thrive. Your flesh grows leathery and tough, and your natural armor bonus improves by 2. In addition, you gain immunity to the effects of dehydration (although not the effects of magical dessication damage) and heat dangers (such as heat exhaustion and sunstroke), sun glare, and sunburn, although fire damage affects you normally.","pillar of salt (sp)":"At 5th level and higher, you can use <a href=\\"/spells/sandstorm--85/flesh-to-salt--3172/\\">flesh to salt</a> once per day, duplicating the effect of the spell (see page 116). Your caster level for this ability is equal to your class level. ","create sand golem (ex)":"At 6th level, you learn the secret of creating a sand golem (see page 82). You do not need the Craft Golem feat to create a sand golem, as you normally would, but you cannot use this ability to create any other type of golem.","create salt mummy (su)":"At 8th level, you learn a specialized form of the ancient art of mummifi cation. Invested with the dark power of the waste, you are able to preserve and animate a corpse. You also add to it the essence of dehydration to produce a horrid salt mummy (see below).","greater drought (su)":"Beginning at 9th level, you can produce extreme desert conditions in a 100-foot radius emanation with you at the center. The temperature band in that area rises by two steps or to severe heat, whichever produces the hotter result. (See Heat Dangers and the effects of natural dehydration in Chapter 1.) You can suppress this effect for 1 round as a free action, but it renews automatically on your next turn unless you consciously suppress it again. This effect supersedes that of the local drought ability.","dry lich":"On reaching 10th level, you learn to apply the secrets of waste preservation to your own body, becoming a dry lich. You must undergo the Sere Rite, overseen by another dry lich, which includes preserving your flesh, removing your organs and storing them in special canopic jars, and imbuing your body with foul magic to make it undying.

To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the war chanter sing (or speak). The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the war chanter sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives +2 temporary hit points for every class level of the war chanter. At 6th level and higher, a war chanter also grants affected allies the benefit of the Diehard feat when using this ability. ","war chanter music":"War chanter music follows the same rules as bardic music (see page 29 of the Player\'s Handbook). War chanter levels stack with bard levels for the purpose of determining how often a character can use war chanter music or bardic music. War chanter levels do not stack with bard levels for determining which songs a bard has access to. ","inspire recklessness (su)":"A War chanter of 3rd level or higher with 12 or more ranks in any Perform skill can use her song or poetics to inspire an often dangerous, but very effective, ferocity in one of her allies within 60 feet (or in himself). The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the war chanter sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally (or the war chanter herself) is inspired to recklessness, gaining the ability to decrease her Armor Class by a number less than or equal to her base attack bonus and add the same number to her melee attack rolls as a morale bonus.","combine songs (su)":"A war chanter of 5th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in any Perform skill can combine two types of bardic music or war chanter music to provide the benefits of both (normal stacking rules for bonus types apply).","inspire awe (su)":"A war chanter of 7th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in any Perform skill can inspire uneasiness, fear, or even terror in her foes. To be affected, a foe must be within 60 feet of the war chanter and must be able to hear the war chanter. Foes get a Will save (DC 10 + war chanter\'s class level + war chanter\'s Cha modifier) to resist the effect. The severity of the effect depends on the difference between the foe\'s Hit Dice and the war chanter\'s Hit Dice (character level). Subtract the foe\'s HD from the war chanter\'s HD and consult the following table. ","singing shout (su)":"When a war chanter of 8th level or higher engages in battle, he often lets out a singing shout as a standard action. All allies (including herself) within a 60-foot radius who can hear the war chanter gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength for a number of rounds equal to one-half the class level of the war chanter.","inspire legion (su)":"A 10th-level war chanter with 18 or more ranks in any Perform skill can unite her allies and make them fight better together.

Only allies who meet these requirements at the beginning of the song are affected, and an ally whose hearing is interrupted or who moves more than 60 feet away from the war chanter cannot rejoin the same song.

Walls and similar obstacles can block a great swing. Start with one square that the war hulk threatens. Each successive square chosen must be adjacent to the previous square and have line of effect from that square. Two squares separated by a wall, for instance, can\'t be chosen as adjacent squares for a great swing. The war hulk may skip creatures, attacking only those he wants to. For example, if there are three creatures in a row&#8212;an enemy, an ally, and another enemy&#8212;the war hulk can choose those three squares for the great swing but strike only the two enemies. If a war hulk drops one of his foes with a great swing, he may make a cleave attack normally. However, he may do so only once for every time he swings, even if he drops more than one foe.","mighty rock throwing (ex)":"Starting at 3rd level, a war hulk gains a powerful rock throwing ability. The character can throw rocks that deal 2d8 points of damage with a range increment of 50 feet. (Like all thrown weapons, they have a maximum range of five range increments.) The war hulk uses his Strength modifier instead of his Dexterity modifier on the attack roll. The rock must weigh approximately 50 pounds.","mighty swing (ex)":"Starting at 4th level, a war hulk can make a mighty swing. A mighty swing is like a great swing, except that it is a standard action rather than a full-round action. Thus, the character can move and make a mighty swing or (if he can make multiple attacks) make multiple mighty swings in a single round.","sweeping boulder (ex)":"Starting at 6th level, a war hulk is able to throw his rocks with such force that they affect two adjacent squares. (The second square must be farther away from the war hulk than the first&#8212;they cannot be equidistant from him.) Make one attack roll and apply the result to each target. As with great swing, the war hulk must have line of effect from one square to the next.","toughness":"At 8th, 9th, and 10th level, a war hulk gains <a href=\\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/toughness--2948/\\">Toughness</a> as a bonus feat.","massive sweeping boulder(ex)":"Starting at 8th level, a war hulk is able to throw his rocks with such force that they affect four squares in a line. (Each successive square chosen must be farther away from the character.) Only the first creature can be subject to damage from a critical hit or a sneak attack. As with great swing, the war hulk must have line of effect from one square to the next.","massive swing (ex)":"A 10th-level war hulk can lash out all around himself with a single attack. Massive swing works like mighty swing, except that its effect is not limited to three squares. The war hulk\'s swing affects all squares he threatens."},"class skills":["climb","intimidate","jump"]},"928":{"name":"War Mind","link":"/classes/expanded-psionics-handbook--65/war-mind/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"35","requirements":{"bab":3,"alignment":["any nonchaotic."],"skills":["Knowledge (history)","Knowledge (psionics)"],"psionics":"Must have a power point reserve of at least 1 power point.","special":"Must have had some instruction by another war mind, have access to Talariic texts, or belong to an organization that has access to Talariic texts."},"skill points":{"base":2,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":1,"fort":2,"ref":2,"will":0,"special":[2],"power points/day":2,"powers known":1,"maximum power level known":1},{"level":2,"bab":2,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":0,"special":[2],"power points/day":9,"powers known":2,"maximum power level known":1},{"level":3,"bab":3,"fort":3,"ref":3,"will":1,"special":["Enduring body (DR 1/&#8212;)"],"power points/day":9,"powers known":2,"maximum power level known":1},{"level":4,"bab":4,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":1,"special":[""],"power points/day":14,"powers known":3,"maximum power level known":2},{"level":5,"bab":5,"fort":4,"ref":4,"will":1,"special":["Sweeping strike"],"power points/day":20,"powers known":3,"maximum power level known":2},{"level":6,"bab":6,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":2,"special":["Enduring body (DR 2/&#8212;)"],"power points/day":28,"powers known":4,"maximum power level known":3},{"level":7,"bab":7,"fort":5,"ref":5,"will":2,"special":[4],"power points/day":37,"powers known":4,"maximum power level known":3},{"level":8,"bab":8,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":2,"special":[4],"power points/day":47,"powers known":5,"maximum power level known":4},{"level":9,"bab":9,"fort":6,"ref":6,"will":3,"special":["Enduring body (DR 3/&#8212;)"],"power points/day":58,"powers known":5,"maximum power level known":4},{"level":10,"bab":10,"fort":7,"ref":7,"will":3,"special":["Chain of overwhelming force"],"power points/day":70,"powers known":6,"maximum power level known":5}],"hit die":10,"class features":{},"class skills":["autohypnosis","concentration","intimidate","knowledge (history)","knowledge (psionics)","psicraft"]},"929":{"name":"War Weaver","link":"/classes/heroes-of-battle--69/war-weaver/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"50","requirements":{"skills":["Craft","Knowledge (arcana)"],"feats":["Enlarge Spell"],"spells":"Ability to cast 3rd-level arcane spells"},"skill points":{"base":2,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":0,"fort":0,"ref":0,"will":2,"special":["Eldritch tapestry"],"spellcasting":""},{"level":2,"bab":1,"fort":0,"ref":0,"will":3,"special":[1],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class"},{"level":3,"bab":1,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":3,"special":[2],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class"},{"level":4,"bab":2,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":[3],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class"},{"level":5,"bab":2,"fort":1,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":["Enlarged tapestry",4],"spellcasting":"+1 level of existing arcane spellcasting class"}],"hit die":4,"class features":{},"class skills":["concentration","craft","knowledge (arcana)","profession","spellcraft"]},"930":{"name":"War Wizard of Cormyr","link":"/classes/magic-of-faerun--20/war-wizard-of-cormyr/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"58","requirements":{"skills":["Spellcraft"],"feats":["Enlarge Spell","Widen Spell","Martial Weapon Proficiency"],"alignment":["any nonevil"," nonchaotic."],"spellcasting":" Ability to cast 4th-level arcane spells."},"skill points":{"base":2,"score":"INT"},"advancement":[{"level":1,"bab":0,"fort":2,"ref":0,"will":2,"special":["Weapon Focus"],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":2,"bab":1,"fort":3,"ref":0,"will":3,"special":["Metamagic Feat"],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":3,"bab":1,"fort":3,"ref":1,"will":3,"special":["Widen Spell"],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":4,"bab":2,"fort":4,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":["Metamagic Feat"],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"},{"level":5,"bab":2,"fort":4,"ref":1,"will":4,"special":["Enhanced Spell Area"],"spells per day":"+1 level of existing class"}],"hit die":4,"class features":{"weapon and armor proficiency":"War wizards gain no proficiency with any weapon or armor.","spells per day":"A war wizard\'s training focuses on magic.

In her training, she learns to adapt to the rapidly changing conditions of the battlefield. Although she may prepare some of her spells with metamagic feats, sometimes she needs to modify a spell on the spur of the moment. Beginning at 3rd level, a war wizard may cast a spell as if it were under the effects of the Widen Spell feat. She does not need to prepare this in advance, and it does not increase the casting time or use a higher spell slot. The war wizard can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma bonus (if any).","enhanced spell area":"Particularly important to war wizards is the ability to use fewer spells to defeat their enemies, so they perfect their understanding of spell dimensions to cast spells affected by the Widen Spell metamagic feat with even greater area. Any time a war wizard of 5th level casts a spell modified by the Widen Spell feat, the area increases by 100% rather than 50%.

From 1st level, she retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. (She still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)","defensive roll (ex)":"A yakuza can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it. Once per day, when a yakuza would be reduced to 0 hit points or less by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the yakuza can attempt to roll with the damage. She makes a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt) and, if she\'s successful, she takes only half damage from the blow. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll&#8212;if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can\'t roll. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the yakuza\'s evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.","improved evasion (ex)":"At 2nd level and above, a yakuza can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If the yakuza makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Even if she fails her saving throw, she takes only half damage. The yakuza can use improved evasion only if she is wearing light armor or no armor.","yakuza knowledge (ex)":"A yakuza, if she\'s doing her job, knows everything that goes on in her &quot;territory,&quot; and a lot about what goes on outside it. A yakuza may make a special yakuza knowledge check with a bonus equal to her class level + her Intelligence modifier to see whether she knows some relevant information about local people or places. The yakuza may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random. The DM will determine the Difficulty Class of the check by referring to the table below:","leadership":"At 5th level, a yakuza gains the <a href=\\"/feats/players-handbook-v35--6/leadership--1740/\\">Leadership</a> feat for free. Yakuza belong to an adoptive family, and can call on other members of their families for assistance. A yakuza\'s followers may be rogues as well as warriors, experts, or commoners. If the yakuza already has the Leadership feat, she gains a permanent +2 bonus on her Leadership score.","slippery mind (ex)":"At 10th level, a yakuza gains the ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a yakuza with slippery mind is affected by magic and fails her saving throw, 1 round later she can attempt her saving throw again. She only gets this one extra chance to succeed at her saving throw."},"class skills":["bluff","diplomacy","disable device","forgery","gather information","hide","innuendo","intimidate","listen","move silently","open lock","pick pocket","sense motive","spot"]},"985":{"name":"Yathchol Webrider","link":"/classes/underdark--34/yathchol-webrider/","isPrestige":true,"bookId":"105","requirements":{"skills":["Hide","Move Silently"],"feats":["Dodge","Mobility","Skill Focus"],"race":"Chitine, or any race that can spin webs from its body.
