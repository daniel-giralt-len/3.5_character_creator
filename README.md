## 3.5 Character creator

DnD 3.5 is an old edition from the 2000s. As such any dnd helper web pages were designed at the time, with all the pros and cons of the era.

This app is meant to be a fresh one stop shop for character creation. It features
- Picking your race
- Picking your (multi)class levels
- Have all the basic modifiers calculated
- Picking feats (only just enough)
- Buy ranks (respecting level maximums)

## Development

The app is still in development, but will feature
- Calculate class requirements
- Calculate feat prerequisites
- Spell picker
- Item budgeting

The full dev board is on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/jOIVfKps/creador-de-personatges-dnd-35) (in catalan).

### Languages
You can translate [game items and web labels](src/db/json/translations) in any language you want.

### "I can do a better interface than you, dweeb."

Rude.

Still, lots of 3.5 data have been stored in [json files](src/db/json). Feel free to use them for your own app. :)
