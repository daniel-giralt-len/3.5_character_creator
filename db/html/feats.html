The characteristics you display might depend in part on the kind of chaotic heritage you have. Regardless of your exact ancestry, you are likely to have one or more unusual physical traits, such as mismatched eyes or untamable and strangely hued hair.The descendants of demons tend to have misshapen features and a terrible temper with a decidedly cruel streak. Eladrin descendants tend to have strong emotional reactions (especially positive emotions) and often become fervent (if short-term) supporters of a cause. Characters with slaad ancestry generally have strongly variable mood swings, and they often take on the personality traits, speech patterns, and clothing styles of those around them in a haphazard and unpredictable manner. Those with titan blood often stand head--and-shoulders above other members of their race; they enjoy experiencing the world around them and become angry when others might merely be bored.Characters with the Anarchic Bloodline feat are nearly always chaotic-aligned. They tend to be restless, desiring change above all else. They are prone to act irrationally, based on sudden whims and flights of fancy. The adventurous life, full of excitement, danger, and travel, appeals to them. Chaos-blooded characters often have a wide variety of spells in their repertoire from all schools and for all manner of uses.

Grig-blooded characters are mischievous and lighthearted, while those with pixie blood are prone to take their pranks too far. Characters with nixie blood are suspicious beings who tend to avoid strangers but remain fiercely loyal to places or persons they love.Sorcerers with fey blood often have changing, fickle natures. They are quick to laugh and play tricks, but slow to forgive or forget slights. They adventure primarily out of a sense of alienation, seeking some place or group to which they can belong. They are fond of spells that deceive and manipulate emotions, such as charm person.">ne of your ancestors was a fey creature, or was ...</td><td><a href="/rulebooks/supplementals-35--5/dragon-compendium--109/">Dragon Compendium</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href="/feats/complete-mage--58/fey-heritage--1110/">Fey Heritage</a></td><td title="You are descended from creatures native to the fey realms.

The characteristics you display might depend in part on the kind of fiendish heritage you have. Many of yourbloodline are dark in coloration, although great variation can exist depending on your specific ancestry.Evil outsiders such as demons and devils produce a surprisingly large number of offspring on the Material Plane. Their descendants are frequently (but not always) evil. Demon-blooded characters and others descended from beings native to the chaotic evil realms are usually chaotic themselves, and at their worst they can be prone to greedy or lustful behavior.Those with devil blood, on the other hand, tend to be lawful. They have no compunctions about bending the rules as far as possible, but they rarely break them. Like their fiendish ancestors, devil-spawn are known for keeping their word.Characters with fiendish blood often seem driven-- even haunted--by the potential for evil within them, especially if they try to hold to a neutral or good path. They frequently adventure out of a restlessness caused by their own internal struggles, although sometimes they do so simply because they enjoy killing and adventuring provides a perfect outlet for that tendency. Such characters usually prefer spells of darkness and deception, even if they are good-aligned.">One of your distant ancestors was an evil outsider.

Your heritage probably stems from one of the humanoid-shaped beings from the Elemental Plane of Fire, although elemental fire creatures native to the Material Plane can contribute this bloodline as well.The descendants of azers see fire as a tool, and they love crafts that control the power of flame. They tend to prefer a regimented life and usually keep their destructive natures in tight check, although they are no less dangerous because of that forbearance. The descendants of fire mephits have a mischievous nature and enjoy destructive pranks, while characters with steam mephits in their ancestry consider themselves above such behavior and often look down on others with considerable arrogance. Fire giant spawn can be ruthless in achieving their goals, and even others with fire blood see them as brutal. None, however, can be as cruel as the descendants of salamanders.Usually hot-tempered and unpredictable, characters with the Fire Bloodline feat can also be passionate, egotistical, and unusually prone to destructive behavior. They usually adventure for a chance at personal gain and glory.

While undead do not reproduce by normal means, their infectious taint might affect necromancers and others who deal regularly with the dead or undead.

The touch of undeath in a family almost exclusively comes from intelligent, corporeal undead. It takes powerful magic or extremely bizarre situations for creatures to gain this feat from unintelligent or incorporeal undead. The descendants of ghouls tend to be feral and constantly hungry. Those with ghast ancestors generally have a strong, unpleasant stench, and they often find it difficult to satiate their hunger. Lich-blooded characters value intelligence and generally have elitist personalities, often appearing gaunt and skeletal. Characters descended from mummies tend to have dull but focused personalities, and many have gaunt, dry skin. Descendants of vampires tend to have long canine teeth and commanding, seductive personalities. Wight-blooded characters tend to have clawlike fingernails and toenails, and lean, muscular bodies; they are generally hate-filled loners who hold grudges. Characters with the Necromantic Bloodline feat often favor wearing the blacks, whites, and grays of mourning.Sorcerers with a touch of the undead in their family trees tend to concentrate, appropriately enough, on spells from the school of necromancy.
