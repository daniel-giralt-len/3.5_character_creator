I've created these scripts as I went.
They involve manually saving htmls, unwritten regex substitutions, page crawling, brain creeping, and generally doing programming wrong.
A wise person'd say there's no wrong way to make program. I found how.
Try not to understand these scripts, ye fool. If you must, rubber duck debug them with Cthulhu, and hug him when inevitably he cries.
